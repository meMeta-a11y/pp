AB Aims: Delay of childhood vaccinations is common and influences efforts to reduce targeted diseases. In Denmark, the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) vaccine is recommended at ages 3, 5 and 12 months and the first measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR-1) at 15 months. Following guidelines, children delayed at age 15 months should receive MMR-1 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 simultaneously, unless DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 was received less than 6 months ago, when MMR-1 alone is recommended. We studied compliance with these guidelines and the reasons for non-compliance with a focus on vaccination providers. Methods: We used a nationwide register-based cohort study of children born in Denmark between January 2000 and June 2013, who were lacking MMR-1 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 at age 15 months and were followed to 24 months. We also performed semi-structured telephone interviews with vaccination providers. Results: The study consisted of 156,921 children (18% of the children born in the period). Among the 40,060 children who had received DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 less than 6 months ago, 37,892 (95%) received MMR-1 alone. Among the 88,469 children who had received DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 more than 6 months ago, 6334 (7%) received DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 and MMR-1 simultaneously. The interviews indicated that some vaccination providers are reluctant to give multiple vaccinations at the same visit and some have a preference of following the usual sequence in the programme. Conclusions: Vaccination providers generally complied with the recommended minimum 6 months' interval between DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3. Conversely, there was a low compliance with the recommendation to administer DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 and MMR-1 simultaneously. More efforts are needed to ensure timely vaccination.

   DIPHTHERIA; IMMUNOGENICITY; SAFETY; COMBINATION; SEPARATE
AB Objective: To provide an overview of prelicensure clinical data for a new pediatric vaccine that combines diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, and inactivated poliovirus vaccines into a single injection (DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine; Pediarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium).
   Methods: The safety and immunogenicity of DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine have been evaluated extensively in clinical trials in infants. To date, DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine has been administered to more than 7000 infants as a 3-dose primary series during the first year of life.
   Results: Studies show that DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine is generally safe, well tolerated, and has not caused any significant serious adverse events. The rates of solicited and unsolicited reports of adverse reactions following vaccination were similar between groups receiving DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine and comparator groups receiving the vaccine components separately. DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine induces immunogenicity (as measured by seroprotection or vaccine response rates to each of the vaccine components [diphtheria, tetanus, 3 pertussis antigens, hepatitis B, and poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3]) similar to licensed vaccine components administered separately,
   Conclusion: In prelicensure clinical studies, DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine was safe and immunogenic when given to infants as a primary 3-dose series. As a single injection of multiple vaccine components, DTaP-HepB-IPV combined vaccine may provide a safe and effective alternative to the current multiple-injection immunization regimen.

AB Background and objective: Live vaccines may have beneficial non-specific effects. We tested whether the live measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine compared with the non-live diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis-inactivated-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) vaccine as the most recent vaccine was associated with less childhood asthma and fewer acute hospital contacts for childhood asthma among boys and girls.
   Methods: This study is a nationwide register-based cohort study of 338 761 Danish children born between 1999 and 2006. We compared (i) the incidence of first-registered childhood asthma based on hospital contacts and drug prescriptions and (ii) the incidence of severe asthma defined as acute hospital contacts for childhood asthma between the ages of 15 and 48 months among children whose last received vaccine was three doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib and then MMR with children whose last received vaccine was three doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib.
   Results: For boys, following the recommended vaccine schedule of MMR after DTaP-IPV-Hib3 compared with DTaP-IPV-Hib3 as the last received vaccine, MMR was associated with 8.1 (95% confidence interval 3.9-12.3) fewer childhood asthma cases per 1000 boys, corresponding to 10% (5-15%) reduction in the cumulative incidence of childhood asthma. MMR, when given last, was also associated with 16.3 (95% confidence interval 12.7-20.0) fewer acute hospital admissions for childhood asthma per 1000 boys, corresponding to a 27% (22-31%) reduction in the cumulative incidence. No associations were seen for girls.
   Conclusion: MMR may have a protective effect against childhood asthma for boys. This calls for an understanding of whether non-specific effects of vaccines can be used to optimize our vaccine programmes.

AB In Shanghai, China, a polio immunization schedule of four inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) has been implemented since 2020, replacing the schedules of a combination of two IPVs and two bivalent live attenuated oral polio vaccines (bOPV), and four trivalent live attenuated oral polio vaccines (tOPV). This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these three schedules in infants born in 2016, in preventing vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). We performed a decision tree model and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Compared to the four-tOPV schedule, the two-IPV-two-bOPV schedule averted 1.2 VAPP cases and 16.83 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) annually; while the four-IPV schedule averted 1.35 VAPP cases and 18.96 DALY annually. Consequently, ICERVAPP and ICERDALY were substantially high for two-IPV-two-bOPV (CNY 12.96 million and 0.93 million), and four-IPV (CNY 21.24 million and 1.52 million). Moreover, net monetary benefit of the two-IPV-two-bOPV and four-IPV schedules was highest when the cost of IPV was hypothesized to be less than CNY 23.75 or CNY 9.11, respectively, and willingness-to-pay was hypothesized as CNY 0.6 million in averting one VAPP-induced DALY. IPV-containing schedules are currently cost-ineffective in Shanghai. They may be cost-effective by reducing the prices of IPV, which may accelerate polio eradication in Chinese settings.

AB Introduction As new vaccines are developed more vaccine coadministrations vaccines are being offered to make delivery more practical for health systems and patients. We compared the safety of coadministered vaccines with separate vaccination for 20 coadministrations by considering nine types of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Methods Real-life immunisation and adverse event data for this observational cohort study were extracted from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre for children registered in the database between 2008 and 2018. We applied the self-controlled case series method to calculate relative incidence ratios (RIR) for AEFI. These RIRs compare the RI of AEFI following coadministration with the RI following separate administration of the same vaccines. Results We assessed 3 518 047 adverse events and included 5 993 290 vaccine doses given to 958 591 children. 17% of AEFI occurred less and 11% more frequently following coadministration than would have been expected based on the RIs following separate vaccinations, while there was no significant difference for 72% of AEFI. We found amplifying interaction effects for AEFI after five coadministrations comprising three vaccines: for fever (RIR 1.93 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.29)), rash (RIR 1.49 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.74)), gastrointestinal events (RIR 1.31 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.49)) and respiratory events (RIR 1.27 (1.17-1.38)) following DTaP/IPV/Hib+MenC+ PCV; gastrointestinal events (RIR 1.65 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.02)) following DTaP/IPV/Hib+MenC+ RV; fever (RIR 1.44 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.90)) and respiratory events (RIR 1.40 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.57)) following DTaP/IPV/Hib+PCV+ RV; gastrointestinal (RIR 1.48 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.82)) and respiratory events (RIR 1.43 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.63)) following MMR+Hib/MenC+PCV; gastrointestinal events (RIR 1.68 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.64)) and general symptoms (RIR 11.83 (95% CI 1.28 to 109.01)) following MMR+MenC+PCV. Coadministration of MMR+PCV led to more fever (RIR 1.91 (95% CI 1.83 to 1.99)), neurological events (RIR 2.04 (95% CI 1.67 to 2.49)) and rash (RIR 1.06 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.11)) compared with separate administration, DTaP/IPV/Hib+MMR to more musculoskeletal events (RIR 3.56 (95% CI 1.21 to 10.50)) and MMR+MenC to more fever (RIR 1.58 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.82)). There was no indication that unscheduled coadministrations are less safe than scheduled coadministrations. Conclusion Real-life RIRs of AEFI justify coadministering routine childhood vaccines according to the immunisation schedule. Further research into the severity of AEFI following coadministration is required for a complete understanding of the burden of these AEFI.

AB Objectives: The vaccine schedule was changed in 2013 in France, which resulted in fewer vaccinations. However, to maintain disease protection, both vaccine timeliness and high coverage should be respected. In the context of growing vaccine hesitancy, we aimed to describe compliance with the immunization program according to the age recommended for each dose for non-preterm children less than 2 years old.
   Methods: Between May 2013 and April 2016, we used automated electronic data capture of electronic medical records for non-preterm children less than 2 years old. Children were followed up by 92 randomly selected pediatricians from the French ambulatory pediatricians group. Delayed immunization was defined as more than 15 days after the recommended age for the primary series of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio-Haemophilus influenzae b-hepatitis B (DTaP-IPV-Hib +/- HB) and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13), 2 months for boosters, 1 month for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)/meningococcal C conjugate (Men-C), and 6 months for the second dose of MMR. An association between delayed first dose and other doses delayed were described with odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Data for 22,097 children in France with 124,702 vaccinations were analyzed: 21.8%, 20.4%, and 30.7% of children had one or more delayed doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib +/- HB, PCV13, and MMR vaccines, respectively. For 47.6% of children, the single-dose Men-C vaccination was delayed. A delayed first dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib +/- HB, PCV13, and MMR was associated with a delayed second dose of the same vaccine (OR 7.5 [95% CI 6.6-8.6], 39.0 [34.1-44.8], and 23.5 [19.1-29.0], respectively) and with a third dose of DTaP-IPVHib +/- HB and PCV13 (14.7 [13.3-17.7] and 3.7 [3.1-4.5]).
   Conclusion: This large study shows that the proportion of children with delayed vaccination in France was globally high and substantial for Men-C and the first MMR vaccination. Risk of a delayed second and third dose was increased with a delayed first dose, which may reflect vaccine hesitancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In England. uptake of the second dose of MMR (against measles, mumps, rubella), and dTaP/IPV or DTaP/IPV booster (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio), is lower than that of the primary course The Immunisation Beliefs and Intentions Measure (IBIM), based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and qualitative interviews, was used to predict parents' intentions to take preschoolers for these recommended vaccinations. Parents from 43 child groups in southern England were randomised to receiving questions about either MMR (N = 193) or dTaP/IPV (N = 159) Overall, 255 parents fully completed TPB-based items Regression analyses revealed that parental attitudes about the protective benefits of immunising and perceived behavioural control were strong, reliable predictors of intention to immunise with MMR. For dTaP/IPV, perceived protective benefits and number of children reliably predicted intention to immunise. Differences between parents with 'maximum immunisation intentions' and those with 'less than maximum intentions' are described. The IBIM appears to be a useful measure for predicting parents' intentions to immunise preschoolers Implications for improving uptake are discussed (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

TI Community transmission of type 2 poliovirus after cessation of trivalent
   oral polio vaccine in Bangladesh: an open-label cluster-randomised trial
   and modelling study
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS; IMMUNITY; INFECTION; CHILDREN; FUTURE
AB Background Trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was replaced worldwide from April, 2016, by bivalent types 1 and 3 oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) where available. The risk of transmission of type 2 poliovirus or Sabin 2 virus on re-introduction or resurgence of type 2 poliovirus after this switch is not understood completely. We aimed to assess the risk of Sabin 2 transmission after a polio vaccination campaign with a monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2).
   Methods We did an open-label cluster-randomised trial in villages in the Matlab region of Bangladesh. We randomly allocated villages (clusters) to either: tOPV at age 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks; or bOPV at age 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks and either one dose of IPV at age 14 weeks or two doses of IPV at age 14 weeks and 18 weeks. After completion of enrolment, we implemented an mOPV2 vaccination campaign that targeted 40% of children younger than 5 years, regardless of enrolment status. The primary outcome was Sabin 2 incidence in the 10 weeks after the campaign in per-protocol infants who did not receive mOPV2, as assessed by faecal shedding of Sabin 2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The effect of previous immunity on incidence was also investigated with a dynamical model of poliovirus transmission to observe prevalence and incidence of Sabin 2 virus. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02477046.
   Findings Between April 30, 2015, and Jan 14, 2016, individuals from 67 villages were enrolled to the study. 22 villages (300 infants) were randomly assigned tOPV, 23 villages (310 infants) were allocated bOPV and one dose of IPV, and 22 villages (329 infants) were assigned bOPV and two doses of IPV. Faecal shedding of Sabin 2 in infants who did not receive the mOPV2 challenge did not differ between children immunised with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV and those who received tOPV (15 of 252 [6%] vs six of 122 [4%]; odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 0.45-3.72; p=0.310). However, faecal shedding of Sabin 2 in household contacts was increased significantly with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV compared with tOPV (17 of 751 [2%] vs three of 353 [1%]; OR 3.60, 95% CI 0.82-15.9; p=0.045). Dynamical modelling of within-household incidence showed that immunity in household contacts limited transmission.
   Interpretation In this study, simulating 1 year of tOPV cessation, Sabin 2 transmission was higher in household contacts of mOPV2 recipients in villages receiving bOPV and either one or two doses of IPV, but transmission was not increased in the community as a whole as shown by the non-significant difference in incidence among infants. Dynamical modelling indicates that transmission risk will be higher with more time since cessation.

AB Delays in achieving the global eradication of wild poliovirus transmission continue to postpone subsequent cessation of all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use. Countries must stop OPV use to end all cases of poliomyelitis, including vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and cases caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019-2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations. Even with optimal nOPV2 performance, countries and the GPEI would still likely need to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization in OPV-using countries if operational improvements in outbreak response to stop the transmission of cVDPV2s are not implemented effectively.

TI Parental attitudes toward multiple poliovirus injections following a
   provider recommendation
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; IMMUNIZATION
AB Objectives. Changes to the polio vaccination schedule, first to a sequential inactivated poliovirus/oral poliovirus (IPV/OPV) schedule in 1996 and most recently to an all-IPV schedule, require infants to receive additional injections. Some surveys show parental hesitation concerning extra injections, whereas others show that parents prefer multiple simultaneous injections over extra immunization visits. This study describes parental behavior and attitudes about the poliovirus vaccine recommendations and additional injections at the 2- and 4-month immunization visits.
   Methods. Beginning July 1, 1996, providers in eight public health clinics in Cobb and Douglas Counties, Georgia, informed parents of polio vaccination options and recommended the IPV/OPV sequential schedule. A cross-sectional clinic exit survey was conducted from July 15, 1996, to January 31, 1997, with parents whose infants (younger than 6 months) were eligible for a first poliovirus vaccination.
   Results. Of approximately 405 eligible infants, parents of 293 infants were approached for an interview, and 227 agreed to participate. Of those 227 participants, 210 (92%) parents chose IPV for their infant and 17 (8%) chose OPV. Of greatest concern to most parents was vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) (155, or 68.3%); the next greatest concern was an extra injection (22, or 9.7%). These parental concerns were unrelated to the number of injections the infant actually received.
   Conclusions. After receiving information on polio vaccination options and a provider recommendation, parents overwhelmingly chose IPV over OPV. Concern about VAPP was more common than objection to an extra injection. The additional injection that results from using IPV for an infant's first poliovirus vaccination appears to be acceptable to most parents.

AB Background: Perinatal immunization education is important for improving the immunization outcomes of infants; however, the content of educational materials used at each perinatal period has not been carefully evaluated. We hypothesized that stepwise education offered at different perinatal periods would improve infant immunization status and enhance maternal immunization knowledge.
   Methods: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, pregnant women were recruited from nine obstetric sites in Niigata, Japan. The intervention group received a stepwise, interactive education intervention (prenatally, postnatally, and 1 month after birth). The control group received a leaflet containing general information on immunization. Infant immunization status was evaluated at 6 months of age, and maternal immunization knowledge was evaluated by a written survey after each intervention.
   Results: Among 188 study participants, 151 (80.3%) replied to the final post-intervention survey. At 6 months of age, the percentage of children who completed three doses of inactivated polio, diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis (DTaP-IPV) vaccine was higher in the intervention group than in the control (p = 0.04); however, no differences between groups were observed for the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (p = 0.67) or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) vaccines (p = 0.20). The duration to the completion of the third dose of the DTaP-IPV, Hib, and PCV13 vaccines was shorter in the intervention group than in the control (p = 0.03, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, maternal knowledge scores exhibited significantly greater improvement in the intervention group over time compared with those of the control group (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Stepwise perinatal immunization education improved immunization schedule adherence for required vaccines and improved maternal immunization knowledge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling Strategies to Increase Population Immunity and Prevent

AB Background. Nigeria continues to struggle in its efforts to eliminate circulating live polioviruses using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).
   Methods.aEuro integral We modeled population immunity, and we estimated cases and the timing of transmission die-out for numerous policies that could accelerate the elimination of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and help Nigeria manage the risks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). We used a differential-equation based poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model focused on northwest Nigeria to characterize the impact and trade-offs of potential vaccination strategies, including the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).
   Results.aEuro integral Northwest Nigeria appears close to reaching the threshold of population immunity it must exceed to stop WPV1 transmission if it continues immunizing previously under-vaccinated children. Avoiding type 2 cVDPVs (cVDPV2s) will depend on using sufficient amounts of trivalent OPV, which will also reduce the risks of cVDPV2s after coordinated cessation of type 2-containing OPV (OPV2). Using IPV during the OPV cessation period may increase population immunity, but it leads to a much lower impact on cVDPV risks than ensuring sufficient trivalent OPV use prior to OPV2 cessation.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral Northwest Nigeria needs to intensify and sustain its immunization efforts to achieve and maintain higher levels of population immunity.

AB This article's objective is to review the "state of the art" in the progress, obstacles, and strategies for achieving global polio eradication. Poliomyelitis control measures began in the 1960s with the advent of two vaccines, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). From 1985 to 2020, strategies were implemented to reach the goal of eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV). Following the success with the interruption of indigenous WPV transmission in the Americas, the goal of global eradication was launched. We describe the process of eradication in four historical stages: (1) The advent of the inactivated and oral polio vaccines launched the age of poliomyelitis control; (2) The massive and simultaneous use of OPV had a significant impact on WPV transmission in the late 1970s in Brazil; (3) Domestic and international public policies set the goal of eradication of indigenous WPV transmission in the Americas and defined the epidemiological strategies to interrupt transmission; and (4) The implementation of eradication strategies interrupted indigenous WPV transmission in nearly all regions of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan, where in 2020 the WPV1 transmission chains have challenged the strategies for containment of the virus. Meanwhile, the persistence and dissemination of circulation of OPV-derived poliovirus in countries with low vaccination coverage, plus the difficulties in replacing OPV with IPV, are currently the obstacles to eradication in the short term. Finally, we discuss the strategies for overcoming the obstacles and challenges in the post-eradication era.

TI Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis-8 PLADs, China, October
   2012-March 2014
SO CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
ID LATIN-AMERICA; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Introduction: Poliomyelitis is a highly contagious, seasonal viral disease caused by any of three poliovirus (PV) serotypes (types 1, 2, or 3). Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) on rare occasions causes vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in recipients of OPV and close contacts of recently vaccinated individuals. This study describes the epidemiology of VAPP when an all OPV schedule was used in the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI).
   Methods: VAPP cases were identified using standardized diagnostic criteria from data reported by 8 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) to the National Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Surveillance System in an 18-month period between October 2012 and March 2014.
   Results: During this period, 28 VAPP cases were reported. Using the number of births as a denominator, the estimated incidence of VAPP was 2.47 cases per million births. Using the number of OPV doses administered through routine immunization, the VAPP incidence was 0.55 cases per million doses. Among vaccine-recipient VAPP cases, 22 (85%) were associated with the first dose of OPV; 3 were associated with the second OPV dose. The relative risk of VAPP following the first dose compared with the second dose was 7.07.
   Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: The per-dose and per-child incidences of VAPP were consistent with incidence estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO). The vast majority (85%) of VAPP in China was associated with the first dose of OPV in an all-OPV schedule. Because inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is known to prevent VAPP from subsequent doses of OPV in immunocompetent children, this association provided strong evidence for using an IPV-first, sequential IPV-OPV polio vaccination schedule in China during the globally-synchronized cessation of type 2 OPV and introduction of IPV in 2016.

AB Background. Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only reservoirs of wild poliovirus transmission. Prior modeling suggested that before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, plans to stop the transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) did not appear on track to succeed.
   Methods. We updated an existing poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model for Pakistan and Afghanistan to characterize the impacts of immunization disruptions and restrictions on human interactions (ie, population mixing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also consider different options for responding to outbreaks and for preventive supplementary immunization activities (SIAs).
   Results. The modeling suggests that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on 1 January 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain off-track for stopping all transmission through 2023 without improvements in quality.
   Conclusions. Using trivalent OPV (tOPV) for SIAs instead of serotype 2 monovalent OPV offers substantial benefits for ending the transmission of both WPV1 and cVDPV2, because tOPV increases population immunity for both serotypes 1 and 2 while requiring fewer SIA rounds, when effectively delivered in transmission areas.

AB Background Our understanding of the acquisition of intestinal mucosal immunity and the control of poliovirus replication and transmission in later life is still emerging.
   Methods As part of a 2011 randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the experimental antiviral agent pocapavir (EudraCT 2011-004804-38), Swedish adults, aged 18-50 years, who had previously received four doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in childhood were challenged with a single dose of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). Using faecal samples collected before and serially, over the course of 45 days, after mOPV1 challenge from a subset of placebo-arm participants who did not receive pocapavir (N=12), we investigated the kinetics of the intestinal antibody response to challenge virus by measuring poliovirus type 1-specific neutralising activity and IgA concentrations.
   Results In faecal samples collected prior to mOPV1 challenge, we found no evidence of pre-existing intestinal neutralising antibodies to any of the three poliovirus serotypes. Despite persistent high-titered vaccine virus shedding and rising serum neutralisation responses after mOPV1 challenge, intestinal poliovirus type 1-specific neutralisation remained low with a titer of <= 18.4 across all time points and individuals. Poliovirus types 1-specific, 2-specific and 3-specific IgA remained below the limit of detection for all specimens collected postchallenge.
   Interpretation In contrast to recent studies demonstrating brisk intestinal antibody responses to oral polio vaccine challenge in young children previously vaccinated with IPV, this investigation finds that adults previously vaccinated with IPV have only modest intestinal poliovirus type 1-specific neutralisation and no IgA responses that are measurable in stool samples following documented mOPV1 infection.

AB Countries face different poliovirus risks, which imply different benefits associated with continued and future use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and/or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). With the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) continuing to extend its timeline for ending the transmission of all wild polioviruses and to introduce new poliovirus vaccines, the polio vaccine supply chain continues to expand in complexity. The increased complexity leads to significant uncertainty about supply and costs. Notably, the strategy of phased OPV cessation of all three serotypes to stop all future incidence of poliomyelitis depends on successfully stopping the transmission of all wild polioviruses. Countries also face challenges associated with responding to any outbreaks that occur after OPV cessation, because stopping transmission of such outbreaks requires reintroducing the use of the stopped OPV in most countries. National immunization program leaders will likely consider differences in their risks and willingness-to-pay for risk reduction as they evaluate their investments in current and future polio vaccination. Information about the costs and benefits of future poliovirus vaccines, and discussion of the complex situation that currently exists, should prove useful to national, regional, and global decisionmakers and support health economic modeling. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with increasing costs of poliovirus vaccines continue to increase financial risks for the GPEI.

TI Cost-effectiveness analysis of changing from live oral poliovirus

SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS; IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB Objective: Estimate the economic impact of introducing inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into the Australian childhood immunisation schedule to eliminate vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).
   Methods: Cost-effectiveness of two different four-dose IPV schedules (monovalent vaccine and IPV-containing combination vaccine) compared with the current four-dose oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) schedule for Australian children through age six years. Model used estimates of VAPP incidence, costs, and vaccine utilisation and price obtained from published and unpublished sources. Main outcome measures were total costs, outcomes prevented, and incremental cost-effectiveness, expressed as net cost per case of VAPP prevented.
   Results: Changing to an IPV-based schedule would prevent 0.395 VAPP cases annually. At $20 per dose for monovalent vaccine and $14 per dose for the IPV component in a combination vaccine, the change would incur incremental, annual costs of $19.5 million ($49.3 million per VAPP case prevented) and $6.7 million ($17.0 million per VAPP case prevented), respectively. Threshold analysis identified break-even prices per dose of $1 for monovalent and $7 for combination vaccines.
   Conclusions: Introducing IPV into the Australian childhood immunisation schedule is not likely to be cost-effective unless it comes in a combined vaccine with the IPV-component price below $10.
   Implications: More precise estimates of VAPP incidence in Australia and IPV price are needed. However, poor cost-effectiveness will make the decision about switching from OPV to IPV in the childhood schedule difficult.

AB This article discusses the strategies and trajectories deployed by the Forum for the Advancement of Immunization Research (FAIR) to rehabilitate Salk's inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), at a time when Sabin's oral polio vaccine (OPV) had come to dominate the global polio vaccine market. FAIR was an international coalition of scientists and institutions that undertook specific field studies to establish the conditions under which IPV could usefully be introduced in developing countries. Regardless of the evidence it gathered, FAIR failed to convince WHO to integrate IPV into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). This study of the life of IPV vaccine beyond its initial development and introduction, provides insights in the interplay of evidence and interests in the political decisions made around vaccination.

   PROGRESS
AB Introduction After trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) cessation, Pakistan has maintained immunity to type 2 poliovirus by administering inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization, alongside monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) and IPV in supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). This study assesses the change in poliovirus type 2 immunity after tOPV withdrawal and due to SIAs with mOPV2 and IPV among children aged 6-11 months. Methods Three cross-sectional sequential serological surveys were conducted in 12 polio high-risk areas of Pakistan. 25 clusters from each geographical stratum were selected utilizing probability proportional to size. Results Seroprevalence of type 2 poliovirus was 49%, with significant variation observed among surveyed areas; <30% in Pishin, >80% in Killa Abdullah, Mardan & Swabi, and Rawalpindi. SIAs with IPV improved immunity from 38 to 57% in Karachi and 60 to 88% in Khyber. SIAs with IPV following mOPV2 improved immunity from 62 to 65% in Killa Abdullah, and combined mOPV2 and IPV SIAs in Pishin improved immunity from 28 to 89%. Results also reflected that immunity rates for serotypes 1 and 3 were consistently above 90% during all three phases and across all geographical areas. Conclusion The study findings highlight the importance of implementing effective vaccination strategies to prevent the re-emergence of poliovirus. Moreover, the results provide crucial information for policymakers working toward achieving global polio eradication.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

ID PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS; IMMUNIZATION POLICY; COMBINING LIVE;
   UNITED-STATES; VACCINATION; DISEASES; TRIAL
AB We describe a successful program of poliomyelitis control using a combination of killed and live polio vaccines over a 10-year period in two developing areas, the West Bank and Gaza, adjacent to a relatively developed country, Israel. During the 1970s, immunization using live trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in these areas covered more than 90 percent of the infant population. Nevertheless, the incidence of paralytic polio continued to be high, with many cases occurring in fully or partially immunized persons. It was thought that this could be due to interference with OPV taken by other enteroviruses present in the environment due to poor sanitary conditions in these areas. A new policy combining five doses of OPV with two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was adopted and implemented in 1978. In the 10 years since then, immunization coverage of infants increased to an estimated 95 percent and paralytic poliomyelitis has been controlled, despite exposure to wild poliovirus from neighboring countries including an outbreak in Israel in 1988. This experience suggests that wide coverage using the combination of IPV and OPV is an effective vaccination policy that may make eradication of polio possible even in developing areas.

TI Insights From Modeling Preventive Supplemental Immunization Activities

   Afghanistan
SO RISK ANALYSIS

DT Article

ID POPULATION IMMUNITY; VACCINE; ERADICATION; RISKS
AB Many countries use supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to keep their population immunity to transmission high using preventive, planned SIAs (pSIAs) and outbreaks response SIAs (oSIAs). Prior studies suggested that investment in pSIAs saved substantial health and financial costs due to avoided outbreaks. However, questions remain about the benefits of SIAs, particularly with the recent introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into routine immunization in all OPV-using countries. The mounting costs of polio eradication activities and the need to respond to oSIAs threatens the use of limited financial resources for pSIAs, including in the remaining countries with endemic transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) (i.e., Pakistan and Afghanistan). A recent updated global poliovirus transmission model suggested that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is not on track to stop transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We use the updated global model to explore the role of pSIAs to achieve WPV1 eradication. We find that unless Pakistan and Afghanistan manage to increase the quality of bivalent OPV (bOPV) pSIAs, which we model as intensity (i.e., sufficiently high-coverage bOPV pSIAs that reach missed children), the model does not lead to successful eradication of WPV1. Achieving WPV1 eradication, the global objectives of the GPEI, and a successful polio endgame depend on effective and sufficient use of OPV. IPV use plays a negligible role in stopping transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan and most other countries supported by the GPEI, and more IPV use will not help to stop transmission.

AB The use of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization to replace Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is crucial in eradicating polio. In June 2014, Nigeria launched an IPV campaign in the conflict-affected states of Borno and Yobe, the largest ever implemented in Africa. We present the initiatives and lessons learned. The 8-day event involved two parallel campaigns. OPV target age was 0-59 months, while IPV targeted all children aged 14 weeks to 59 months. The Borno state primary health care agency set up temporary health camps for the exercise and treated minor ailments for all. The target population for the OPV campaign was 685 674 children in Borno and 113 774 in Yobe. The IPV target population for Borno was 608 964 and for Yobe 111 570. OPV coverage was 105.1 per cent for Borno and 103.3 per cent for Yobe. IPV coverage was 102.9 per cent for Borno and 99.1 per cent for Yobe. (Where we describe coverage as greater than 100 per cent, this reflects original underestimates of the target populations.) A successful campaign and IPV immunization is viable in conflict areas.

AB Beginning in January 1997, American immunization policy allowed parents and physicians to elect one of three approved infant vaccination strategies for preventing poliomyelitis. Although the three strategies likely have different outcomes with respect to prevention of paralytic poliomyelitis, the extreme rarity of the disease in the USA prevents any controlled comparison. In this paper, a formal inferential logic, originally described by Donald Rubin, is applied to the vaccination problem. Assumptions and indirect evidence are used to overcome the inability to observe the same subjects under varying conditions to allow the inference of causality from non-randomized observations. Using available epidemiologic information and explicit assumptions, it is possible to project the risk of paralytic polio for infants immunized with oral polio vaccine (1.3 cases per million vaccinees), inactivated polio vaccine (0.54 cases per million vaccinees), or a sequential schedule (0.54-0.92 cases per million vaccinees).

AB Achieving the goal of a world free of poliomyelitis still requires significant effort. Although polio immunization represents a mature area, the polio endgame will require new tools and strategies, particularly as national and global health leaders coordinate the cessation of all three serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine and increasingly adopt inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Poliovirus epidemiology and the global options for managing polioviruses continue to evolve, along with our understanding and appreciation of the resources needed and the risks that require management. Based on insights from modeling, we offer some perspective on the current status of plans and opportunities to achieve and maintain a world free of wild polioviruses and to successfully implement oral poliovirus vaccine cessation. IPV costs and potential wastage will represent an important consideration for national policy makers. Innovations may reduce future IPV costs, but the world urgently needs lower-cost IPV options.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the costs of vaccination regimens for introducing inactivated polio vaccine in routine immunization in Brazil.
   METHODS: A cost analysis was conducted for vaccines in five vaccination regimens, including inactivated polio vaccine, compared with the oral polio vaccine-only regimen. The costs of the vaccines were estimated for routine use and for the "National Immunization Days", during when the oral polio vaccine is administered to children aged less than five years, independent of their vaccine status, and the strategic stock of inactivated polio vaccine. The presented estimated costs are of 2011.
   RESULTS: The annual costs of the oral vaccine-only program (routine and two National Immunization Days) were estimated at US$19,873,170. The incremental costs of inclusion of the inactivated vaccine depended on the number of vaccine doses, presentation of the vaccine (bottles with single dose or ten doses), and number of "National Immunization Days" carried out. The cost of the regimen adopted with two doses of inactivated vaccine followed by three doses of oral vaccine and one "National Immunization Day" was estimated at US$29,653,539. The concomitant replacement of the DTPw/Hib and HepB vaccines with the pentavalent vaccine enabled the introduction of the inactivated polio without increasing the number of injections or number of visits needed to complete the vaccination.
   CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the inactivated vaccine increased the annual costs of the polio vaccines by 49.2% compared with the oral vaccine-only regimen. This increase represented 1.13% of the expenditure of the National Immunization Program on the purchase of vaccines in 2011.

AB Background. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative plans to stop all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after wild poliovirus eradication, starting with serotype 2. Stakeholders continue to discuss the role of using inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to manage the risks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) during the end game.
   Methods.aEuro integral We use a poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model to explore the impact of various routine immunization policies involving IPV on population immunity dynamics and the probability and magnitude of cVDPV emergences following OPV cessation.
   Results.aEuro integral Adding a single IPV dose to an OPV-only routine immunization schedule at or just before OPV cessation produces very limited impact on the probability of cVDPV emergences and the number of expected polio cases in settings in which we expect cVDPVs in the absence of IPV use. The highest-cost option of switching to a 3-dose IPV schedule only marginally decreases cVDPV risks. Discontinuing supplemental immunization activities while introducing IPV prior to OPV cessation leads to an increase in cVDPV risks.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral Introducing a dose of IPV in countries currently using OPV only for routine immunization offers protection from paralysis to successfully vaccinated recipients, but it does little to protect high-risk populations from cVDPV risks.

TI Considerations for implementing a new combination vaccine into managed

LA English
DT Article
ID HEPATITIS-B-VIRUS; TETANUS-ACELLULAR PERTUSSIS; INACTIVATED POLIO VIRUS;
   DIPHTHERIA; IMMUNOGENICITY; INFANTS
AB Background: The control and elimination of several deadly childhood diseases are a result of extensive vaccination efforts made by pediatricians, family practitioners, public health providers, and health outreach systems. Managed care can assist this effort through facilitating the delivery of affordable quality healthcare to patients.
   Objective: To describe the considerations made by managed care when implementing a new vaccine into practice.
   Results: Managed care plans often assess the medical necessity, consumer acceptance, and pharmacoeconomic benefits of a vaccine when considering whether it can be implemented into practice. DTaP-HepB-IPV (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B [Recombinant] and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine [Combined]), a new combination vaccine, has demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety when compared with separately administered component vaccines. Use of this combination vaccine will help to simplify the current immunization schedule, and therefore decrease the number of injections infants receive in the first year of life, favorably influencing consumer perception of this new vaccine. A reduction in the number of office visits as a result of fewer injections and improved vaccine compliance may result in a positive pharmacoeconomic impact on parents, physicians, and payers. Reduced ad ministration fees, fewer needed syringes, and decreased risk of needlestick injury resulting from the use of combination vaccines all may have a positive impact on acceptance of these vaccines by managed care organizations.
   Conclusion: DTaP-HepB-IPV is expected to meet the tests of medical appropriateness, consumer acceptance, and pharmacoeconomic reasonableness, thereby fulfilling the value proposition of a new combination vaccine for managed healthcare plans.

TI Assessing the stability of polio eradication after the withdrawal of

   CONTROLLED-TRIAL; LIVE VIRUS; TRANSMISSION; EXCRETION
AB The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.

AB Pakistan and Afghanistan pose risks for international transmission of polioviruses as the last global reservoir for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and a reservoir for type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV2s). Widespread transmission of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in 2019-2020 and resumption of intensive supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) in 2020-2021 using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) led to decreased transmission of WPV1 and cVDPV2 as of the end of 2021. Using an established dynamic disease transmission model, we explore multiple bounding scenarios with varying intensities of SIAs using bivalent OPV (bOPV) and/or trivalent tOPV (tOPV) to characterize potential die out of transmission. This analysis demonstrates potential sets of actions that may lead to elimination of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and/or Afghanistan. Some modeled scenarios suggest that Pakistan and Afghanistan could increase population immunity to levels high enough to eliminate transmission, and if maintained, achieve WPV1 and cVDPV2 elimination as early as 2022. This requires intensive and proactive OPV SIAs to prevent transmission, instead of surveillance followed by reactive outbreak response. The reduction of cases observed in 2021 may lead to a false sense of security that polio has already or soon will die out on its own, but relaxation of immunization activities runs the risk of lowering population immunity to, or below, the minimum die-out threshold such that transmission continues. Transmission modeling may play a key role in managing expectations and supporting future modeling about the confidence of no virus circulation in anticipation of global certification decisions.

AB The polio endgame remains complicated, with many questions about future polio vaccines and national immunization policies. We simulated possible future poliovirus vaccine routine immunization policies for countries stratified by World Bank Income Levels and estimated the expected costs and cases using an updated integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission, stochastic risk, and economic model. We consider two reference cases scenarios: one that achieves the eradication of all wild polioviruses (WPVs) by 2023 and one in which serotype 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission continues. The results show that the addition of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to routine immunization in all countries substantially increased the expected costs of the polio endgame, without substantially increasing its expected health or economic benefits. Adding a second dose of IPV to the routine immunization schedules of countries that currently include a single IPV dose further increases costs and does not appear economically justified in the reference case that does not stop WPV transmission. For the reference case that includes all WPV eradication, adding a second IPV dose at the time of successful oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation represents a cost-effective option. The risks and costs of needing to restart OPV use change the economics of the polio endgame, although the time horizon used for modeling impacts the overall economic results. National health leaders will want to consider the expected health and economic net benefits of their national polio vaccine strategies recognizing that preferred strategies may differ.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Although poliovirus vaccines led to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of poliomyelitis in the USA, there is evidence that vaccine-related cases have occurred in vaccine recipients (recipient cases) and their contacts (contact cases) and that the incidence and epidemiologic characteristics of these cases in the 12-yr period 1961-1972 have changed. Before 1965, there were 63 recipient cases compared with only 16 between 1965 and 1972. These latter cases were in younger persons and were more frequently associated with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (TOPV) than the former cases. Both groups were predominantly male and had intervals between immunization and onset of illness that clustered between 7-21 days. Only 3 contact cases were recognized before 1965, compared with 39 cases in 1965-1972. The increase was in children and adults. Unlike recipient cases, contact cases were almost as frequent in females as in males. Evidence that the contact cases were vaccine-related included the apparent clustering between 20-29 days of the intervals from vaccine administration to onset of illness and the significantly increased frequency of longer intervals for contact cases in non-household members compared with contact cases in household members. The decrease in recipient cases and the increase in contact cases in 1965-1972 compared with the previous 3-yr period are explained by the general curtailing of routine vaccination of adults after 1964, a switch from monovalent oral polio vaccine to TOPV, improved recognition of contact cases and a shift in emphasis from mass vaccination campaigns and communitywide programs to routine vaccination of infants.

TI Characterization of outbreak response strategies and potential vaccine
   stockpile needs for the polio endgame
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES

DT Article
DE Polio; Eradication; Risk management; Vaccine; Stockpile
ID POPULATION IMMUNITY; TRANSMISSION; OPTIONS
AB Background: Following successful eradication of wild polioviruses and planned globally-coordinated cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), national and global health leaders may need to respond to outbreaks from reintroduced live polioviruses, particularly vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Preparing outbreak response plans and assessing potential vaccine needs from an emergency stockpile require consideration of the different national risks and conditions as they change with time after OPV cessation.
   Methods: We used an integrated global model to consider several key issues related to managing poliovirus risks and outbreak response, including the time interval during which monovalent OPV (mOPV) can be safely used following homotypic OPV cessation; the timing, quality, and quantity of rounds required to stop transmission; vaccine stockpile needs; and the impacts of vaccine choices and surveillance quality. We compare the base case scenario that assumes aggressive outbreak response and sufficient mOPV available from the stockpile for all outbreaks that occur in the model, with various scenarios that change the outbreak response strategies.
   Results: Outbreak response after OPV cessation will require careful management, with some circumstances expected to require more and/or higher quality rounds to stop transmission than others. For outbreaks involving serotype 2, using trivalent OPV instead of mOPV2 following cessation of OPV serotype 2 but before cessation of OPV serotypes 1 and (would represent a good option if logistically feasible. Using mOPV for outbreak response can start new outbreaks if exported outside the outbreak population into populations with decreasing population immunity to transmission after OPV cessation, but failure to contain outbreaks resulting in exportation of the outbreak poliovirus may represent a greater risk. The possibility of mOPV use generating new long-term poliovirus excretors represents a real concern. Using the base case outbreak response assumptions, we expect over 25 % probability of a shortage of stockpiled filled mOPV vaccine, which could jeopardize the achievement of global polio eradication. For the long term, responding to any poliovirus reintroductions may require a global IPV stockpile. Despite the risks, our model suggests that good risk management and response strategies can successfully control most potential outbreaks after OPV cessation.
   Conclusions: Health leaders should carefully consider the numerous outbreak response choices that affect the probability of successfully managing poliovirus risks after OPV cessation.

AB Aim: Assess risks related to breaches of poliovirus containment. Method: Using a dynamic transmission model, we explore the variability among different populations in the vulnerability to poliovirus containment breaches as population immunity to transmission declines after oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation. Results: Although using OPV instead of wild poliovirus seed strains for inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) production offers some expected risk reintroduction of live polioviruses from IPV manufacturing facilities, OPV seed strain releases may become a significant threat within 5-10 years of OPV cessation in areas most conducive to fecal-oral poliovirus transmission, regardless of IPV use. Conclusion: Efforts to quantify the risks demonstrate the challenges associated with understanding and managing relatively low probability and high-consequence containment failure events.

ID UNITED-STATES; TIMELINESS; RATES
AB Objective: To evaluate the impact of a pentavalent combination vaccine on childhood immunization coverage rates and timeliness within a managed care organization.
   Study Design: Retrospective matched-cohort analysis of encounter data from administrative claims and state immunization registry.
   Methods: Children were stratified into 2 demographically matched cohorts (combination and reference), based on receipt of the DTaP/HepB/IPV combination vaccine. Children were followed until 24 months of age, and coverage rates and on-time rates were assessed. Outcomes were measured for the HEDIS Combination 2 vaccine series (4 doses of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, 3 doses of polio, 1 dose of measles/mumps/ rubella, 3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b, 3 doses of hepatitis B, and 1 dose of varicella) and each vaccine series individually.
   Results: Children in the combination cohort were significantly more likely to be fully vaccinated for the HEDIS Combination 2 series by 2 years of age and to be vaccinated within the recommended age ranges. In the combination cohort 86.9% (752/865) of patients were fully covered compared with only 74.1% (641/865) of the reference cohort (P <.001). In the combination cohort 45.2% (391/865) of patients received vaccinations on time versus 37.5% (324/865) of the reference cohort, P =.001.
   Conclusions: Receipt of DTaP/HepB/IPV was associated with improved coverage and age-appropriate immunization in a managed care population.

AB BackgroundMother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important global health issue. We hypothesized that the live attenuated poliovirus existing in oral polio vaccine (OPV) may protect uninfected neonates born to HIV-positive mothers through the stimulation of innate immune system. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that countries using OPV have a lower MTCT rate (due to postnatal protection provided by the vaccine) compared with those using only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). MethodsIn an ecological study, the incidence of HIV/AIDS in children aged <1 year (IncHIV1), considered a surrogate index for MTCT rate, was compared between countries using OPV vs. IPV. The aggregated population data were retrieved for 204 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2019) Collaborative Network website, "Our World in Data" website, the World Bank website, and the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). We used a negative binomial regression model with IncHIV1 as the dependent variable and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in women aged 15-49 years (PrevHIV), antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, human development index (HDI), and the type of vaccine used in each country as independent variables. Multivariate imputation by chained equations was used to treat missing values. Analyses were performed for both the original dataset (with missing values) and the five imputed datasets. ResultsIncHIV1 and PrevHIV were available for all 204 countries; vaccine type, 194 countries; HDI, 182 countries; and ART coverage, 133 countries. One-hundred and twenty-nine countries in the original dataset had complete data for all the above-mentioned variables; the imputed datasets had complete data for all 204 countries. The results obtained from the analysis of the original dataset had no overall difference with the pooled results obtained from the analysis of the five imputed datasets. Countries with higher HDI mainly use IPV; those with lower HDI commonly use OPV. PrevHIV, HDI, and the type of vaccine were independent predictors of IncHIV1. Use of OPV compared to IPV, was independently associated with an average decrease of 17% in IncHIV1 at the median HDI of 0.75. The protection provided by OPV increased in countries with lower HDI. ConclusionsUse of OPV compared with IPV, was independently associated with lower MTCT rate.

AB As the Global Polio Eradication Initiative progresses toward the eradication of wild polioviruses, national and global health leaders must still actively consider options for managing poliovirus risks, including risks associated with using oral poliovirus vaccine. Oral poliovirus vaccine continues to represent a highly effective tool, but its use causes noticeable, rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio and with low coverage it can evolve to become circulating vaccine-derived polioviruse that causes outbreaks. National leaders face a wide range of options, but their choices depend in part on global policies. This article explores the current set of global options for poliovirus eradication or control, discusses constraints and prerequisites for their implementation and offers some insights based on dynamic modeling to inform discussions and frame future economic analyses.

AB Objective: To compare well-baby visit and vaccination schedule adherence up to age 24 months in children of mothers with versus without schizophrenia. Methods: Using administrative health data on births in Ontario, Canada (2012-2016), children of mothers with schizophrenia (ICD-9: 295; ICD-10: F20/ F25; DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) (n=1,275) were compared to children without maternal schizophrenia (n=520,831) on (1) well-baby visit attendance, including an enhanced well-baby visit at age 18-months, and (2) vaccine schedule adherence for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B (DTaP-IPV-Hib), and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR). Cox proportional hazard regression models were adjusted for each of maternal sociodemographics, maternal health, and child health characteristics in blocks and all together in a fully adjusted model. Results: About 503% of children with maternal schizophrenia had an enhanced 18-month well-baby visit versus 58.6% of those without, corresponding to 29.0 versus 33.9 visits/100 person-years (PY), a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.89). The association was dampened after adjustment for maternal sociodemographics, maternal health, and child health factors in blocks and overall, with a fully adjusted HR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.98). Full vaccine schedule adherence occurred in 40.0% of children with maternal schizophrenia versus 46.0% of those without (22.6 vs 25.9/100 PY), yielding a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.94). The association was dampened when adjusted for maternal sociodemographics and child health characteristics and became nonsignificant when adjusted for maternal health characteristics.The fully adjusted HR was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87-1.04). Conclusions: Increased efforts to ensure that children with maternal schizophrenia receive key early preventive health care services are warranted.

AB Despite high coverage rates of polio vaccine in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the seroconversion rates of infants may be inadequate. This study measured seroprevalence of antibodies against poliovirus serotypes 1 to 3 (PV1, PV2 and PV3) in 7-month-old infants who had received at least 4 doses of trivalent oral polio vaccine. A serosurvey was conducted in 2010 in rural areas of Chabahar, Sistan-va-Baluchestan province. Using cluster sampling, 72 eligible infants were tested for antibody against the 3 poliovirus serotypes according to WHO guidelines. Antibody titres >= 1:10 were considered positive. The seropositive rates for antibody against PV1, PV2 and PV3 were 84.7%, 95.8% and 70.8% respectively. Only 63.9% of participants were seropositive for antibodies against all 3 poliovirus serotypes. Except for PV2, the seroprevalence of antibody against the other 2 poliovirus serotypes, especially PV3, was unsatisfactory.

AB Background Novel oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) was used to control an outbreak of type 2 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) in Tajikistan, in 2021. We measured seroconversion and seroprevalence of type 2 polio antibodies in children who were reported to have received two doses of nOPV2 in outbreak response campaigns.
   Methods In this community serosurvey, children born after Jan 1, 2016 were enrolled from seven districts in Tajikistan. Dried blood spot cards were collected before nOPV2 campaigns and after the first and second rounds of the campaigns and were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) for microneutralisation assay to determine presence of polio antibodies. The primary endpoint was to assess change in seroprevalence and seroconversion against poliovirus serotype 2 after one and two doses of nOPV2.
   Findings 228 (97%) of 236 enrolled children were included in the analysis. The type 2 antibody seroprevalence was 26% (53/204; 95% CI 20 to 33) before nOPV2, 77% (161/210; 70 to 82) after one dose of nOPV2, and 83% (174/209; 77 to 88) after two doses of nOPV2. The increase in seroprevalence was statistically significant between baseline and after one nOPV2 dose (51 percentage points [42 to 59], p<0.0001), but not between the first and second doses (6 percentage points [-2 to 15], p=0.12). Seroconversion from the first nOPV2 dose, 67% (89/132; 59 to 75), was significantly greater than that from the second nOPV2 dose, 44% (20/45; 30 to 60; chi(2) p=0.010). Total seroconversion after two nOPV2 doses was 77% (101/132; 68 to 83).
   Interpretation Our study demonstrated strong immune responses following nOPV2 outbreak response campaigns in Tajikistan. Our results support previous clinical trial data on the generation of poliovirus type 2 immunity by nOPV2 and provide evidence that nOPV2 can be appropriate for the cVDPV2 outbreak response. The licensure and WHO prequalification of nOPV2 should be accelerated to facilitate wider use of the vaccine. Copyright (C) 2022 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier.

AB Due to security, access, and programmatic challenges in areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, both countries continue to sustain indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission and threaten the success of global polio eradication and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation. We fitted an existing differential-equation-based poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model to Pakistan and Afghanistan using four subpopulations to characterize the well-vaccinated and undervaccinated subpopulations in each country. We explored retrospective and prospective scenarios for using inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization or supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). The undervaccinated subpopulations sustain the circulation of serotype 1 WPV and serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus. We find a moderate impact of past IPV use on polio incidence and population immunity to transmission mainly due to (1) the boosting effect of IPV for individuals with preexisting immunity from a live poliovirus infection and (2) the effect of IPV-only on oropharyngeal transmission for individuals without preexisting immunity from a live poliovirus infection. Future IPV use may similarly yield moderate benefits, particularly if access to undervaccinated subpopulations dramatically improves. However, OPV provides a much greater impact on transmission and the incremental benefit of IPV in addition to OPV remains limited. This study suggests that despite the moderate effect of using IPV in SIAs, using OPV in SIAs remains the most effective means to stop transmission, while limited IPV resources should prioritize IPV use in routine immunization.

TI Budget impact of polio immunization strategy for India: introduction of
   one dose of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine and reductions in
   supplemental polio immunization
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Polio immunization; Budget impact; Polio eradication; OPV; IPV
AB Objectives: To conduct a budget impact analysis (BIA) of introducing the immunization recommendations of India Expert Advisory Group (IEAG) for the years 2015-2017. The recommendations include introduction of one inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) dose in the regular child immunization programme along with reductions in oral polio vaccine (OPV) doses in supplemental programmes.
   Study design: This is a national level analysis of budget impact of new polio immunization recommendations. Since the states of India vary widely in terms of size, vaccine coverage and supplemental vaccine needs, the study estimated the budget impact for each of the states of India separately to derive the national level budget impact.
   Methods: Based on the recommendations of IEAG, the BIA assumes that all children in India will get an IPV dose at 14 weeks of age in addition to the OPV and DPT (or Pentavalent-3) doses. Cost of introducing the IPV dose was estimated by considering vaccine price and vaccine delivery and administration costs. The cost savings associated with the reduction in number of doses of OPV in supplemental immunization were also estimated. The analysis used India-specific or international cost parameters to estimate the budget impact.
   Results: Introduction of one IPV dose will increase the cost of vaccines in the regular immunization programme from $20 million to $47 million. Since IEAG recommends lower intensity of supplemental OPV vaccination, polio vaccine cost of supplemental programme is expected to decline from $72 million to $53 million. Cost of administering polio vaccines will also decline from $124 million to $105 million mainly due to the significantly lower intensity of supplemental polio vaccination. The net effect of adopting IEAG's recommendations on polio immunization turns out to be cost saving for India, reducing total polio immunization cost by $6 million. Additional savings could be achieved if India adopts the new policy regarding the handling of multi-dose vials after opening. Introduction of three doses of IPV with the existing polio immunization schedule will increase the budget requirement by $102 million but replacing OPV doses with IPV will increase the budget by about $59 million. Discontinuation of supplemental OPV immunization with replacement of OPV by IPV will reduce the Government of India's (GOI) polio immunization budget by $99 million.
   Conclusion: Although the overall cost of polio programme will decline with the adoption of IEAG's recommendations, state-level costs will vary widely. In states like Kerala, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, cost of polio immunization will increase while in Punjab and Jharkhand the costs will remain more or less constant. Significant cost reductions will happen in states with high intensity of supplemental polio immunizations (Bihar, Haryana and Delhi). The cost of procuring polio vaccines will more than double from $20 million to about $47 million requiring allocation of additional foreign exchanges. In some states (like Bihar), the decline in polio-related employment will be very high requiring reallocation of personnel from polio to other programmes.

AB Poliovirus infection causes paralysis in up to 1 in 200 infected persons. The use of safe and effective inactivated poliovirus vaccines and live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) means that only two pockets of wildtype poliovirus type 1 remain, in Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, OPVs can revert to virulence, causing outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). During 2020-2022, cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) was responsible for 97-99% of poliomyelitis cases, mainly in Africa. Between January and August 2022, cVDPV2 was detected in sewage samples in Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, where a case of acute flaccid paralysis caused by cVDPV2 also occurred. The Pan American Health Organization has warned that Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Peru are at very high risk for the reintroduction of poliovirus and an additional eight countries in Latin America are at high risk, following dropping vaccination rates (average 80% coverage in 2022). Sabin type 2 monovalent OPV has been used to control VDPV2 outbreaks, but its use could also lead to outbreaks. To address this issue, a more genetically stable, novel OPV2 (nOPV2) was developed against cVDPV2 and in 2020 was granted World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing. Rolling out a novel vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing in mass settings to contain outbreaks requires unique local regulatory and operational preparedness.

AB Decisionmakers need information about the anticipated future costs of maintaining polio eradication as a function of the policy options under consideration. Given the large portfolio of options, we reviewed and synthesized the existing cost data relevant to current policies to provide context for future policies. We model the expected future costs of different strategies for continued vaccination, surveillance, and other costs that require significant potential resource commitments. We estimate the costs of different potential policy portfolios for low-, middle-, and high-income countries to demonstrate the variability in these costs. We estimate that a global transition from routine immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) would increase the costs of managing polio globally, although routine IPV use remains less costly than routine OPV use with supplemental immunization activities. The costs of surveillance and a stockpile, while small compared to routine vaccination costs, represent important expenditures to ensure adequate response to potential outbreaks. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses highlight important uncertainty in the aggregated costs and demonstrates that the discount rate and uncertainty in price and administration cost of IPV drives the expected incremental cost of routine IPV vs. OPV immunization.

TI Retrospective hospital-based searches for cases of acute flaccid
   paralysis
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; ACCURACY
AB Objective: Australia had to demonstrate adequate acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance by achieving a rate of one per 100,000 in children under the age of 15 to fulfil one of the requirements of the Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication to be declared polio free. To increase the ascertainment rate of AFP cases, a hospital search was conducted to identify cases not reported to the active AFP surveillance.
   Methods: A computerised search of hospital admissions in New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA) on ICD-9 codes of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), unspecified encephalitis, poliomyelitis, vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and flaccid paralysis was conducted for the period 1995-98. Medical records of cases that were not reported to the active surveillance were reviewed in three hospitals of NSW and two hospitals in WA.
   Results: Twenty additional cases recorded as GBS and five as transverse myelitis (TM) were identified through the searches, which increased the average four-year AFP rate from 1.0 to 1.4 per 100,000 in children under the age of 15 years in these two states and the overall AFP rate in Australia increased from 0.78 to 1.14. There were no cases of polio or VAPP found. Nine cases of GBS and five of TM reported to the active AFP surveillance were not found in the hospital searches.
   Conclusion: A combination of active surveillance and hospital-based searches increased the investigated AFP rate, which fulfilled one of the certification requirements for Australia to be certified polio free.
   Implications: Until global certification is achieved, AFP surveillance needs to be improved to identify cases of importation of wild poliovirus.

AB The World Health Organization recommends that all children aged less than 5 years should be vaccinated against polio through intensive immunization programmes as well as routine immunization. A national immunization week (NIW) was held in February 2002 in the Monterrey district of Mexico. A prospective microcosting study was conducted to measure the total cost to the state of the NIW, the cost profile, and the ratio of cost per immunization contact to cost per dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV), and to compare OPV and inactive polio vaccine (IPV) in economic terms. Two scenarios were used as the basis for calculation. The cost of volunteers was excluded from the 'lower-cost scenario' and included in the 'uppercost scenario'. The total cost of the NIW was US $100,454 for the lower-cost scenario and US $156,614 for the upper-cost scenario. The major part of the costs was personnel costs (67.30 and 77.53% of the total costs in the lower- and upper-cost scenario, respectively). The ratio of cost per immunization contact to cost per dose of OPV was 6.45 for the tower-cost scenario and 10.05 for the upper-cost scenario. Changing from the current OPV-based intensive and routine schedule to a sequential IPV-OPV routine schedule would save US $14.52 per vaccinated child, and changing to a full IPV routine schedule would save US $9.41 per vaccinated child.

AB BackgroundIt is necessary to select suitable inactivated poliovirus vaccine(IPV) and live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) sequential immunization programs and configure the corresponding health resources. An economic evaluation was conducted on the sequential procedures of Sabin strain-based IPV (sIPV) and bivalent OPV (bOPV) with different doses to verify whether a cost-effectiveness target can be achieved. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different sIPV immunization schedules, which would provide convincing evidence to further change the poliovirus vaccine (PV) immunization strategies in China. MethodsFive strategies were included in this analysis. Based on Strategy 0(S-0), the incremental cost (IC), incremental effect (IE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the four different strategies (S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4) were calculated based on the perspective of the society. Seven cost items were included in this study. Results of field investigations and expert consultations were used to calculate these costs. ResultsThe ICs of S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4 was Chinese Yuan (CNY) 30.77, 68.58, 103.82, and 219.82 million, respectively. The IE of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (IEVAPP) cases of S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4 were 0.22, 0.22, 0.22, and 0.11, respectively, while the IE of disability-adjusted life-years (IEDALY) of S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4 were 8.98, 8.98, 8.98, and 4.49, respectively. The ICERVAPP of S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4 gradually increased to CNY 13.99, 31.17, 47.19, and 199.83 million/VAPP, respectively. The ICERDALY of S-1/S-2/S-3/S-4 also gradually increased to CNY 0.34, 0.76, 1.16, and 4.90 million/DALY, respectively. ConclusionICER(VAPP) and ICERDALY were substantially higher for S-3 (four-sIPV) and S-4 (replacement of self-funded sIPV based on one-sIPV-three-bOPV). Two-sIPV-two-bOPV had a cost-effectiveness advantage, whereas S2/S3/S4 had no cost-effectiveness advantage.

AB This article synthesizes the important lessons learned from polio eradication in the Region of the Americas, including initial and more recent challenges and best practices, as well as particular factors surrounding attainment of this ambitious goal. Using documents, interviews, and country surveys, the authors describe and analyze the strategies and lessons learned during the 40 years of the Expanded Program on Immunization (1977 - 2017). Some major milestones and challenges specifically covered are: the Vaccine-derived Poliovirus (VDPV) outbreak in the Dominican Republic; the regional "mop-up operation;" poliovirus containment in essential facilities; the unprecedented introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV); the synchronized switch from trivalent to bivalent OPV; and the countries' unfailing commitment to the cause.

TI The risk of type 2 oral polio vaccine use in post-cessation outbreak
   response

AB Background: Wild type 2 poliovirus was last observed in 1999. The Sabin-strain oral polio vaccine type 2 (OPV2) was critical to eradication, but it is known to revert to a neurovirulent phenotype, causing vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. OPV2 is also transmissible and can establish circulating lineages, called circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), which can also cause paralytic outbreaks. Thus, in April 2016, OPV2 was removed from immunization activities worldwide. Interrupting transmission of cVDPV2 lineages that survive cessation will require OPV2 in outbreak response, which risks seeding new cVDPVs. This potential cascade of outbreak responses seeding VDPVs, necessitating further outbreak responses, presents a critical risk to the OPV2 cessation effort.
   Methods: The EMOD individual-based disease transmission model was used to investigate OPV2 use in outbreak response post-cessation in West African populations. A hypothetical outbreak response in northwest Nigeria is modeled, and a cVDPV2 lineage is considered established if the Sabin strain escapes the response region and continues circulating 9 months post-response. The probability of this event was investigated in a variety of possible scenarios.
   Results: Under a broad range of scenarios, the probability that widespread OPV2 use in outbreak response (similar to 2 million doses) establishes new cVDPV2 lineages in this model may exceed 50% as soon as 18 months or as late as 4 years post-cessation.
   Conclusions: The risk of a cycle in which outbreak responses seed new cVDPV2 lineages suggests that OPV2 use should be managed carefully as time from cessation increases. It is unclear whether this risk can be mitigated in the long term, as mucosal immunity against type 2 poliovirus declines globally. Therefore, current programmatic strategies should aim to minimize the possibility that continued OPV2 use will be necessary in future years: conducting rapid and aggressive outbreak responses where cVDPV2 lineages are discovered, maintaining high-quality surveillance in all high-risk settings, strengthening the use of the inactivated polio vaccine as a booster in the OPV2-exposed and in routine immunization, and gaining access to currently inaccessible areas of the world to conduct surveillance.

AB Only Pakistan and Afghanistan reported any polio cases caused by serotype 1 wild polioviruses (WPV1s) in 2017. With the dwindling cases in both countries and pressure to finish eradication with the least possible resources, a danger exists of inappropriate prioritization of efforts between the two countries and insufficient investment in the two countries to finish the job. We used an existing differential-equation-based poliovirus transmission and oral poliovirus (OPV) evolution model to simulate a proactive strategy to stop transmission, and different hypothetical reactive strategies that adapt the quality of supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) in response to observed polio cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan. To account for the delay in perception and adaptation, we related the coverage of the SIAs in high-risk, undervaccinated subpopulations to the perceived (i.e., smoothed) polio incidence. Continuation of the current frequency and quality of SIAs remains insufficient to eradicate WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Proactive strategies that significantly improve and sustain SIA quality lead to WPV1 eradication and the prevention of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks. Reactive vaccination efforts that adapt moderately quickly and independently to changes in polio incidence in each country may succeed in WPV1 interruption after several cycles of outbreaks, or may interrupt WPV1 transmission in one country but subsequently import WPV1 from the other country or enable the emergence of cVDPV outbreaks. Reactive vaccination efforts that adapt independently and either more rapidly or more slowly to changes in polio incidence in each country may similarly fail to interrupt WPV1 transmission and result in oscillations of the incidence. Reactive strategies that divert resources to the country of highest priority may lead to alternating large outbreaks. Achieving WPV1 eradication and subsequent successful OPV cessation in Pakistan and Afghanistan requires proactive and sustained efforts to improve vaccination intensity in under-vaccinated subpopulations while maintaining high population immunity elsewhere.

TI Expected Implications of Globally Coordinated Cessation of Serotype 3
   Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) Before Serotype 1 OPV
SO RISK ANALYSIS

DT Article
DE Dynamic modeling; eradication; oral poliovirus vaccine; polio
AB Globally coordinated cessation of all three serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) represents a critical part of a successful polio endgame, which the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to conduct in phases, with serotype 2 OPV cessation completed in mid 2016. Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID-19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019.

AB Polio eradication, like all eradication efforts, is a gamble. If it fails, much of the money spent will have been wasted. If it succeeds, the world will reap a dividend. Success or failure and the magnitude of the dividend depend on a long chain of "weakest links." In this paper I identify these links and explain how the chain can be strengthened. A crucial vulnerability is the current plan to halt vaccination using the live-attenuated oral polio vaccine in the post-eradication era. This weakest link can be strengthened by efforts that lower the cost to poor countries of vaccinating with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine.

AB Uganda officially introduced the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in May 2016 as part of the polio eradication strategy and integrated it into its routine immunization programme in addition to the oral polio vaccine. The current coverage stands at 60% as of July 2017. We therefore aimed to determine factors associated with the uptake of IPV among children in Kalungu District so as to inform the implementation of the vaccine policy. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among caregivers of 406 eligible children aged 12-23 months through multi-stage systematic sampling and a standardized semi-structured questionnaire. Nine key informant interviews were conducted through purposive selection of health care providers and members of Village Health Teams (VHTs) based on their expertize. Modified Poisson regression and thematic content analysis were used to determine factors significant to IPV uptake among children. 71% of sampled children aged 12-23 months had received IPV in Kalungu District. The survey found that being encouraged by health workers and VHTs was significant to children's uptake of IPV (Adjusted PR 1.24, 95% CI; 1.22-3.47). Distance to the immunization point (Adjusted PR 0.32,95% CI; 0.16-0.62) and caregiver's education level (Adjusted PR 1.16,95% CI; 1.05-2.22) were also associated with IPV uptake. Qualitative findings from health workers and VHT members further confirmed the perception that distance to the immunization post was important, and VHTs also stated that being encouraged by health workers was critical to IPV uptake. The current prevalence of IPV uptake among children aged 12-23 months in Kalungu is 71%, higher than the last reported national coverage (60%), though still below the recommended national coverage of 95%. Efforts should be focused on sensitization of caregivers through health workers and VHTs. Immunization outreach should be strengthened so as to bring services closer to patients.

AB Movements of populations from countries where polio has not been eradicated is a concern in the Islamic Republic of Iran. A cross-sectional, community-based study was implemented in 2010 in 2 districts in Sistan-va-Baluchestan Province near the south-east border. The aim was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies in children aged 20 (+/- 2) months who had received at least 5 doses of trivalent oral polio vaccine. Using cluster sampling, 365 children were enrolled for serological testing. Antibody titres >= 1:10 were considered positive. Seropositive rates for antibody against poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 were 94.1%, 96.7% and 78.3% respectively. The lowest seropositive rate was for antibody against polio serotype 3 (PV3) among boys (58.3%). Exclusive breastfeeding showed a direct relationship with antibody response to PV3 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-3.6). Improving community protection against PV3 is an urgent programme priority.

AB Poliomyelitis has appeared in epidemic form, become endemic on a global scale, and been reduced to near-elimination, all within the span of documented medical history. Epidemics of the disease appeared in the late 19th century in many European countries and North America, following which polio became a global disease with annual epidemics. During the period of its epidemicity, 1900-1950, the age distribution of poliomyelitis cases increased gradually. Beginning in 1955, the creation of poliovirus vaccines led to a stepwise reduction in poliomyelitis, culminating in the unpredicted elimination of wild polioviruses in the United States by 1972. Global expansion of polio immunization resulted in a reduction of paralytic disease from an estimated annual prevaccine level of at least 600,000 cases to fewer than 1,000 cases in 2000. Indigenous wild type 2 poliovirus was eradicated in 1999, but unbroken localized circulation of poliovirus types 1 and 3 continues in 4 countries in Asia and Africa. Current challenges to the final eradication of paralytic poliomyelitis include the continued transmission of wild polioviruses in endemic reservoirs, reinfection of polio-free areas, outbreaks due to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, and persistent excretion of vaccine-derived poliovirus by a few vaccinees with B-cell immunodeficiencies. Beyond the current efforts to eradicate the last remaining wild polioviruses, global eradication efforts must safely navigate through an unprecedented series of endgame challenges to assure the permanent cessation of all human poliovirus infections.

AB Inherent in the decision to launch the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988 was the expectation for many people that immunization against poliomyelitis would eventually simply stop, as had been the case with smallpox following its eradication in 1977. However, the strategies for managing the risks associated with a "polio-free" world must be continuously refined to reflect new developments, particularly in our understanding of the live polioviruses in the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and in the international approach to managing potential biohazards. The most important of these developments has been the confirmation in 2000 that vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can circulate and cause polio outbreaks, making the use of OPV after interruption of wild poliovirus transmission incompatible with a polio-free world. A comprehensive strategy has been developed to minimize the risks associated with eventual OPV cessation, centered on appropriate long-term biocontainment of poliovirus stocks (whether for vaccine production, diagnosis, or research), the controlled reintroduction of any live poliovirus vaccine (i.e., from an OPV stockpile), and appropriate use of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Although some aspects of this risk management strategy are still debated, there is wide agreement that no strategy would entirely eliminate the potential risks to a polio-free world. The current strategy for risk management in a polio-free world will continue to evolve with better characterization of these risks and the development of more effective approaches both to reduce those risks and to limit their consequences should they occur.

TI Combinations of Quality and Frequency of Immunization Activities to Stop
   and Prevent Poliovirus Transmission in the High-Risk Area of Northwest

AB Background
   Frequent supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) represent the primary strategy to interrupt poliovirus transmission in the last endemic areas.
   Materials and Methods
   Using a differential-equation based poliovirus transmission model tailored to high-risk areas in Nigeria, we perform one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the impact of different assumptions about routine immunization (RI) and the frequency and quality of SIAs on population immunity to transmission and persistence or emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) after OPV cessation.
   Results
   More trivalent OPV use remains critical to avoid serotype 2 cVDPVs. RI schedules with or without inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) could significantly improve population immunity if coverage increases well above current levels in under-vaccinated subpopulations. Similarly, the impact of SIAs on overall population immunity and cVDPV risks depends on their ability to reach under-vaccinated groups (i.e., SIA quality). Lower SIA coverage in the under-vaccinated subpopulation results in a higher frequency of SIAs needed to maintain high enough population immunity to avoid cVDPVs after OPV cessation.
   Conclusions
   National immunization program managers in northwest Nigeria should recognize the benefits of increasing RI and SIA quality. Sufficiently improving RI coverage and improving SIA quality will reduce the frequency of SIAs required to stop and prevent future poliovirus transmission. Better information about the incremental costs to identify and reach under-vaccinated children would help determine the optimal balance between spending to increase SIA and RI quality and spending to increase SIA frequency.

AB IntroductionDetection of poliovirus transmission and ongoing oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use continue to delay poliomyelitis eradication. In 2016, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of type 2 OPV (OPV2) for preventive immunization and limited its use to emergency outbreak response. In 2019, GPEI partners requested restart of some Sabin OPV2 production and also accelerated the development of a genetically modified novel OPV2 vaccine (nOPV2) that promised greater genetic stability than monovalent Sabin OPV2 (mOPV2). MethodsWe reviewed integrated risk, economic, and global poliovirus transmission modeling performed before OPV2 cessation, which recommended multiple risk management strategies to increase the chances of successfully ending all transmission of type 2 live polioviruses. Following OPV2 cessation, strategies implemented by countries and the GPEI deviated from model recommended risk management strategies. Complementing other modeling that explores prospective outbreak response options for improving outcomes for the current polio endgame trajectory, in this study we roll back the clock to 2017 and explore counterfactual trajectories that the polio endgame could have followed if GPEI had: (1) managed risks differently after OPV2 cessation and/or (2) developed nOPV2 before and used it exclusively for outbreak response after OPV2 cessation. ResultsThe implementation of the 2016 model-based recommended outbreak response strategies could have ended (and could still substantially improve the probability of ending) type 2 poliovirus transmission. Outbreak response performance observed since 2016 would not have been expected to achieve OPV2 cessation with high confidence, even with the availability of nOPV2 prior to the 2016 OPV2 cessation. DiscussionAs implemented, the 2016 OPV2 cessation failed to stop type 2 transmission. While nOPV2 offers benefits of lower risk of seeding additional outbreaks, its reduced secondary spread relative to mOPV2 may imply relatively higher coverage needed for nOPV2 than mOPV2 to stop outbreaks.

AB Background: The endgame for polio eradication involves coordinated global cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) with cessation of serotype 2 OPV (OPV2 cessation) implemented in late April and early May 2016 and cessation of serotypes 1 and 3 OPV (OPV13 cessation) currently planned for after 2018. The logistics associated with globally switching all use of trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) represent a significant undertaking, which may cause some complications, including delays that lead to different timing of the switch across shared borders.
   Methods: Building on an integrated global model for long-term poliovirus risk management, we consider the expected vulnerability of different populations to transmission of OPV2-related polioviruses as a function of time following the switch. We explore the relationship between the net reproduction number (R-n) of OPV2 at the time of the switch and the time until OPV2-related viruses imported from countries still using OPV2 can establish transmission. We also analyze some specific situations modeled after populations at high potential risk of circulating serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreaks in the event of a non-synchronous switch.
   Results: Well-implemented tOPV immunization activities prior to the tOPV to bOPV switch (i.e., tOPV intensification sufficient to prevent the creation of indigenous cVDPV2 outbreaks) lead to sufficient population immunity to transmission to cause die-out of any imported OPV2-related viruses for over 6 months after the switch in all populations in the global model. Higher Rn of OPV2 at the time of the switch reduces the time until imported OPV2-related viruses can establish transmission and increases the time during which indigenous OPV2-related viruses circulate. Modeling specific connected populations suggests a relatively low vulnerability to importations of OPV2-related viruses that could establish transmission in the context of a non-synchronous switch from tOPV to bOPV, unless the gap between switch times becomes very long (>6 months) or a high risk of indigenous cVDPV2s already exists in the importing and/or the exporting population.
   Conclusions: Short national discrepancies in the timing of the tOPV to bOPV switch will likely not significantly increase cVDPV2 risks due to the insurance provided by tOPV intensification efforts, although the goal to coordinate national switches within the globally agreed April 17-May 1, 2016 time window minimized the risks associated with cross-border importations.

AB Background: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative plans for coordinated cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after interrupting all wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission, but many questions remain related to long-term poliovirus risk management policies.
   Methods: We used an integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission and stochastic risk model to simulate possible futures and estimate the health and economic outcomes of maintaining the 2013 status quo of continued OPV use in most developing countries compared with OPV cessation policies with various assumptions about global inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) adoption.
   Results: Continued OPV use after global WPV eradication leads to continued high costs and/or high cases. Global OPV cessation comes with a high probability of at least one outbreak, which aggressive outbreak response can successfully control in most instances. A low but non-zero probability exists of uncontrolled outbreaks following a poliovirus reintroduction long after OPV cessation in a population in which IPV-alone cannot prevent poliovirus transmission. We estimate global incremental net benefits during 2013-2052 of approximately $16 billion (US$2013) for OPV cessation with at least one IPV routine immunization dose in all countries until 2024 compared to continued OPV use, although significant uncertainty remains associated with the frequency of exportations between populations and the implementation of long term risk management policies.
   Conclusions: Global OPV cessation offers the possibility of large future health and economic benefits compared to continued OPV use. Long-term poliovirus risk management interventions matter (e.g., IPV use duration, outbreak response, containment, continued surveillance, stockpile size and contents, vaccine production site requirements, potential antiviral drugs, and potential safer vaccines) and require careful consideration. Risk management activities can help to ensure a low risk of uncontrolled outbreaks and preserve or further increase the positive net benefits of OPV cessation. Important uncertainties will require more research, including characterizing immunodeficient longterm poliovirus excretor risks, containment risks, and the kinetics of outbreaks and response in an unprecedented world without widespread live poliovirus exposure.

AB Objectives. Transmission of polio poses a threat to military forces when deploying to regions where such viruses are endemic. US-born soldiers generally enter service with immunity resulting from childhood immunization against polio; moreover, new recruits are routinely vaccinated with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), supplemented based upon deployment circumstances. Given residual protection from childhood vaccination, risk-based vaccination may sufficiently protect troops from polio transmission. Methods. This analysis employed a mathematical system for polio transmission within military populations interacting with locals in a polio-endemic region to evaluate changes in vaccination policy. Results. Removal of blanket immunization had no effect on simulated polio incidence among deployed military populations when risk-based immunization was employed; however, when these individuals reintegrated with their base populations, risk of transmission to nondeployed personnel increased by 19%. In the absence of both blanket- and risk-based immunization, transmission to nondeployed populations increased by 25%. The overall number of new infections among nondeployed populations was negligible for both scenarios due to high childhood immunization rates, partial protection against transmission conferred by IPV, and low global disease incidence levels. Conclusion. Risk-based immunization driven by deployment to polio-endemic regions is sufficient to prevent transmission among both deployed and nondeployed US military populations.

TI Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programmes in India
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The World Health Organisation's programme for the eradication of poliomyelitis as currently practised in India raises many ethical issues. In this paper we concentrate on just two. The first is the balance to be struck between the risks and benefits generated by the eradication programme itself. The issue of risks and benefits arises in relation to the choice between two different vaccine types available for polio programmes: oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). OPV is the vaccine currently used in the eradication campaign in India. We argue that given the current risks/benefits profile of this vaccine, there is an urgent need to review the programme and take remedial action to address existing problems (at least in India). The second issue we discuss is the fact that there is little effort to gain the informed consent of the parents of vaccinated children, as they are not currently told about the potential limitations of OPV or the possibility of vaccine-induced harm. We suggest that such a policy might be justifiable, given the importance of polio eradication, but only if there is a system of compensation for vaccine-induced harm as part of the eradication programme itself. There is a real danger that if these issues are not addressed then public trust in the eradication programme and vaccination programmes as a whole will be lost.

AB In the context of global vaccine politics 'vaccine independence' has been defined as the assumption of financial responsibility for vaccine procurement. This paper suggests 'the possibility of vaccine choice' as an alternative meaning for the term. How far does local competence in vaccine development and production provide that possibility? Coupled to the national vaccination programme, such competence enabled the Netherlands to make use of a polio vaccine (Inactivated Polio Vaccine, or IPV) that it was felt best met national needs even though the rest of the world had switched to the alternative attenuated vaccine (generally known as Oral Polio Vaccine, or OPV); by the 1970s IPV was no longer commercially available. Over the past 20 years major changes in vaccine politics have occurred. Does the earlier conclusion regarding local competence still hold? The more recent example of pertussis (or whooping cough) vaccines, where again controversy surrounds the relative merits of alternative vaccines, permits the question to be posed anew. Results of our analysis from the Netherlands suggest, first, that the pressure to conform has become greater, and second, that the taken-for-granted globalism of today's vaccine system is in need of critical examination.

AB Background: Most poliovirus infections occur with no symptoms and this leads to the possibility of silent circulation, which complicates the confirmation of global goals to permanently end poliovirus transmission. Previous simple models based on hypothetical populations assumed perfect detection of symptomatic cases and suggested the need to observe no paralytic cases from wild polioviruses (WPVs) for approximately 3-4 years to achieve 95% confidence about eradication, but the complexities in real populations and the imperfect nature of surveillance require consideration.
   Methods: We revisit the probability of undetected poliovirus circulation using a more comprehensive model that reflects the conditions in a number of places with different characteristics related to WPV transmission, and we model the actual environmental WPV detection that occurred in Israel in 2013. We consider the analogous potential for undetected transmission of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. The model explicitly accounts for the impact of different vaccination activities before and after the last detected case of paralytic polio, different levels of surveillance, variability in transmissibility and neurovirulence among serotypes, and the possibility of asymptomatic participation in transmission by previously-vaccinated or infected individuals.
   Results: We find that prolonged circulation in the absence of cases and thus undetectable by case-based surveillance may occur if vaccination keeps population immunity close to but not over the threshold required for the interruption of transmission, as may occur in northwestern Nigeria for serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in the event of insufficient tOPV use. Participation of IPV-vaccinated individuals in asymptomatic fecal-oral transmission may also contribute to extended transmission undetectable by case-based surveillance, as occurred in Israel. We also find that gaps or quality issues in surveillance could significantly reduce confidence about actual disruption. Maintaining high population immunity and high-quality surveillance for several years after the last detected polio cases will remain critical elements of the polio end game.
   Conclusions: Countries will need to maintain vigilance in their surveillance for polioviruses and recognize that their risks of undetected circulation may differ as a function of their efforts to manage population immunity and to identify cases or circulating live polioviruses.

AB COVID-19 led to a recent high-profile proposal to reintroduce oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the United States (U.S.), initially in clinical trials, but potentially for widespread and repeated use. We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.

AB Poliovirus importations into polio-free countries represent a major concern during the final phases of global eradication of wild polioviruses (WPVs). We extend dynamic transmission models to demonstrate the dynamics of population immunity out through 2020 for three countries that only used inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for routine immunization: the US, Israel, and The Netherlands. For each country, we explore the vulnerability to re-established transmission following an importation for each poliovirus serotype, including the impact of immunization choices following the serotype 1 WPV importation that occurred in 2013 in Israel. As population immunity declines below the threshold required to prevent transmission, countries become at risk for re-established transmission. Although importations represent stochastic events that countries cannot fully control because people cross borders and polioviruses mainly cause asymptomatic infections, countries can ensure that any importations die out. Our results suggest that the general US population will remain above the threshold for transmission through 2020. In contrast, Israel became vulnerable to re-established transmission of importations of live polioviruses by the late 2000s. In Israel, the recent WPV importation and outbreak response use of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) eliminated the vulnerability to an importation of poliovirus serotypes 1 and 3 for several years, but not serotype 2. The Netherlands experienced a serotype I WPV outbreak in 1992-1993 and became vulnerable to re-established transmission in religious communities with low vaccine acceptance around the year 2000, although the general population remains well-protected from widespread transmission. All countries should invest in active management of population immunity to avoid the potential circulation of imported live polioviruses. IPV-using countries may wish to consider prevention opportunities and/or ensure preparedness for response. Countries currently using a sequential IPV/OPV schedule should continue to use all licensed OPV serotypes until global OPV cessation to minimize vulnerability to circulation of imported polioviruses.

AB Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance actively detects new paralytic infections caused by wild poliovirus (WPV). However, most WPV infections occur with no symptom. This complicates determining when WPV is eradicated in the context of stopping oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Previous studies have used the time since the last paralytic infection as a variable of interest to construct this probability. In this study, we show that more freely available information can be used. In particular, we focus on enriching the computation of the probability of WPV silent circulation with the date of occurrence of the last paralytic infection. We show that this information can for at least one set of conditions have crucial importance for an accurate estimation of the risk of false positive when declaring WPV eradicated. We also look at the importance of this information for optimal dynamic vaccination strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the intensifying global efforts to eradicate wild polioviruses, policymakers face complex decisions related to achieving eradication and managing posteradication risks. These decisions and the expanding use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) trigger renewed interest in poliovirus immunity, particularly the role of mucosal immunity in the transmission of polioviruses. Sustained high population immunity to poliovirus transmission represents a key prerequisite to eradication, but poliovirus immunity and transmission remain poorly understood despite decades of studies. In April 2010, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened an international group of experts on poliovirus immunology and virology to review the literature relevant for modeling poliovirus transmission, develop a consensus about related uncertainties, and identify research needs. This article synthesizes the quantitative assessments and research needs identified during the process. Limitations in the evidence from oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) challenge studies and other relevant data led to differences in expert assessments, indicating the need for additional data, particularly in several priority areas for research: (1) the ability of IPV-induced immunity to prevent or reduce excretion and affect transmission, (2) the impact of waning immunity on the probability and extent of poliovirus excretion, (3) the relationship between the concentration of poliovirus excreted and infectiousness to others in different settings, and (4) the relative role of fecal-oral versus oropharyngeal transmission. This assessment of current knowledge supports the immediate conduct of additional studies to address the gaps.

AB Objective. To study the effect of an educational videotape about poliovirus vaccines and choices of schedules for parents/guardians of children starting the polio vaccination series.
   Design. Prospective, randomized trial comparing two educational interventions.
   Setting. Five pediatric offices (two university-based, two health maintenance organization staff models, and one private practice) and a local health department immunization clinic in the greater Lansing, MI, area.
   Participants. A total of 287 parents/guardians of 2- to 9-month-olds presenting for well-child care and due for the first set of immunizations including poliovirus vaccine.
   Interventions. Parents/guardians were randomized to read the vaccine information statement (VIS) alone or to read the VIS and view a 15-minute videotape about polio vaccination and choices of schedules produced by Michigan State University. The intervention groups were similar by race/ethnicity, education, and relationship to the child.
   Outcome Measures. Change in knowledge about the risk of poliomyelitis in the United States, transmission of poliomyelitis, characteristics of the two poliovirus vaccines, and choices of polio vaccination schedules; and parent opinion on effectiveness of the interventions, as measured by pre- and postintervention questionnaires.
   Results. Both interventions resulted in increased test scores of knowledge. However, videotape viewers scored significantly higher on their posttest compared with parents/guardians assigned to VIS only. This significant increase was noted across all practice types, two of three major racial/ethnic groups, and educational levels. (The increase for Hispanic parents/guardians approached significance). Reading the VIS did not improve? posttest scores for videotape viewers. Reading the VIS did improve posttest scores for those assigned. to VIS only, but these scores still were not as high as for videotape viewers who did not read the VIS.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated that a complicated discussion of risks/benefits of two vaccines and their schedules of administration could be communicated effectively via a videotaped presentation. In addition, the videotape was more effective than VIS alone in increasing short-term knowledge, regardless of practice type, race/ethnicity, or educational level. As immunization schedules increase in complexity and parents are asked to make more choices, videotaped information may be a better method to achieve the goal of truly informed consent.

AB The creation of two different vaccines to eradicate polio stands out as one of modern science most important accomplishments. The current article examines Swedish polio vaccine research, the vaccination campaign and especially how the Cutter incident came to affect Swedish Science, scientists and society in the 1950s. Sweden is one of the few countries that came to produce its own inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the 19505, a type of vaccine they never abandoned. This article highlights the sometimes conflicting approaches between medical science on one hand and media and public on the other. The Swedish researchers did not agree with Jonas Salk's methods for producing a safe vaccine and had reserved attitudes when the Salk vaccine was announced, something that Swedish media disapproved of. After the Cutter incident media's representation of Swedish polio scientists became far more positive. The article also shows the development and distribution of a Swedish IPV and that contrary to some other countries Sweden did not doubt all American manufacturers and imported Salk IPV for the first polio vaccination campaign.

   ECONOMIC VALUE; DIPHTHERIA; IMMUNOGENICITY; REACTOGENICITY; PENTAVALENT;
   SEPARATE; INFANTS
AB Background: The number of recommended immunizations during childhood has increased significantly over the years. Today, infants receive vaccines against 11 diseases in the first 2 years of life, and may receive as many as 5 injections at a single office visit. For a number of reasons, some injections may be deferred to a later visit, thus creating a missed opportunity for vaccination.
   Objective: To review benefits of pediatric combination vaccines.
   Results: Combination vaccines that protect against several diseases, such as the new DTaP-HepB-IPV (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B [Recom-binant] and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Combined) vaccine, can help to simplify the current immunization schedule Other benefits of combination vaccines for parents and healthcare providers include decreased anxiety because of perceived reduction in pain for the infant, fewer missed opportunities to vaccinate, convenience, and decreased costs for the parent as a result of fewer office visits. Benefits of using combination vaccines in the office setting include reduced missed opportunities to vaccinate, storage of fewer vials, decreased risk of needle sticks as a result of handling fewer syringes, and potentially improved record keeping and tracking. Benefits of using combination vaccines in managed care include improved member satisfaction and lower costs because of fewer vaccine administration charges, and potentially fewer office visits.
   Conclusions: Combination vaccines are an effective means of decreasing the number of injections and simplifying the immunization schedule, thus providing overall benefits to infants, parents, healthcare providers, office managers, and managed care administrators.

TI Between individualism and social solidarity in vaccination policy: the
   case of the 2013 OPV campaign in Israel
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOETHICS; HEALTH
AB Background: During the summer of 2013, after samples of poliomyelitis virus were found in sewage, Israel launched an intensive national oral polio vaccine (OPV) campaign. The clinical objective of the campaign was rather clear. With not a single case of infantile paralysis and with a population already highly protected with IPV (a dead version of the vaccine), the goal was to foster collective immunity so that risk populations could also be protected. This, however, entailed a rather unusual issue: how to persuade parents whose children already received an IPV to revaccinate their children, now with a live yet attenuated version of the virus that was excluded from the national vaccination program in 2004. The challenge therefore was a call for social solidarity - asking parents to vaccinate their children mainly for the sake of protecting unknown at risk populations and to take part in the larger global goals of the polio eradication program. This challenge stands at the core of our investigation. We see the OPV campaign of summer 2013 as a good case study of the tension between individualism and social solidarity in seeking the cooperation of the public.
   Methods: We draw on a qualitative study that included participant observation, document reviews and interviews with policy-makers, parents, journalists, public health experts and community leaders. These data were analyzed in order to unravel the ways in which self-interest, community and solidarity were conceived by different agents during the vaccination campaign.
   Results: The family as a metaphor for social solidarity was the main discursive item in the public campaign. Tensions, dissonances and inconsistencies were found between different registers and agencies as to what is at stake and what is required.
   Conclusions: We discuss the ethical and social implications of our findings in order to better understand how persuasion was used in the current case and for its future role in similar events, within and outside Israel, when global efforts to eradicate polio are ongoing.

TI Vaccination status and needs of asylum-seeking children in Denmark: a
   retrospective data analysis
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Asylum-seeking children; Vaccination; Immunisation; Denmark
ID MIGRATION; HEALTH
AB Objectives: Asylum seekers to Europe may come from war-torn countries where health systems have broken down, and there is evidence that asylum-seeking children have low coverage of childhood vaccinations, as well as uptake of immunisations in host countries. Such gaps in immunisation have important implications for effective national vaccination programmes. How we approach vaccination in children and adults entering Western Europe, where as a group they face barriers to health services and screening, is a growing debate; however, there are limited data on the vaccination status of these hard-to-reach communities, and robust evidence is needed to inform immunisation strategies. The aim of this study was to explore the vaccination status and needs of asylum-seeking children and adolescents in Denmark.
   Study design: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of anonymised patient records for asylum-seeking children and adolescents extracted from the Danish Red Cross database.
   Methods: We retrospectively searched the Danish Red Cross database for children and adolescents (aged 3 months-17 years) with active asylum applications in Denmark as of October 28, 2015. Data were extracted for demographic characteristics, vaccination status and vaccinations needed by asylum-seeking children presenting to Red Cross asylum centres for routine statutory health screening.
   Results: We explored the vaccination status and needs of 2126 asylum-seeking children and adolescents. About 64% of the study population were male and 36% were female. Eight nationalities were represented, where 33% of the total of children and adolescents were not immunised in accordance with Danish national guidelines, while 7% were considered partly vaccinated, and 60% were considered adequately vaccinated. Afghan (57% not vaccinated/unknown) and Eritrean (54% not vaccinated/unknown) children were the least likely to be vaccinated of all nationalities represented, as were boys (37% not vaccinated/unknown) compared with girls (27% not vaccinated/unknown) and children and adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years (48% not vaccinated/unknown) compared with 6- to 11 year olds (26%) and 0- to 5-year olds (22%). The health screenings resulted in 1328 vaccinations. The most commonly needed vaccines were diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b, (DTaP/IPV/Hib) which comprised 49% of the vaccines distributed, followed by the pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar) (28%) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine (23%).
   Conclusions: The finding that nearly one-third of asylum-seeking children and adolescents in Denmark were in need of further vaccinations highlights the gaps in immunisation coverage in these populations. These results point to the need to improve access to health services and promote national vaccine programmes targeted at these communities to facilitate vaccination uptake and increase immunisation coverage to reduce the risk of preventable infectious diseases among asylum-seeking children.

AB Since 2013, wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission occurred only for type 1 (WPV1). Following several years of increasing reported incidence (2017-2019) and programmatic disruptions caused by COVID-19 (early 2020), Pakistan and Afghanistan performed a large number of supplementary immunization activities (late 2020-2021). This increased intensity of immunization, following widespread transmission, substantially decreased WPV1 cases and positive environmental samples during 2021. Modeling the potential for undetected circulation of WPV1 after apparent interruption can support regional and global decisions about certification of the eradication of indigenous WPV1 transmission. We apply a stochastic model to estimate the confidence about no circulation (CNC) of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan as a function of time since the last reported case and/or positive environmental sample. Exploration of different assumptions about surveillance quality suggests a range for CNC for WPV1 as a function of time since the last positive surveillance signal, and supports the potential use of a time with no evidence of transmission of less than 3 years as sufficient to assume die out in the context of good acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. We show high expected CNC based on AFP surveillance data alone, even with imperfect surveillance and some use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine masking the ability of AFP surveillance to detect transmission. Ensuring high quality AFP and environmental surveillance may substantially shorten the time required to reach high CNC. The time required for high CNC depends on whether immunization activities maintain high population immunity and the quality of surveillance data.

AB On the 60th th anniversary of the initiation of the polio vaccination campaign in Spain, the significant milestone in achieving disease control is highlighted. There has been a shift from an incidence of over 2,000 yearly cases in the 1960s to a sustained absence of wild poliovirus (WPV) since 1988. Despite the observed negative impact on polio vaccination coverage at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, these rates gradually recovered, reaching 98.2% in primary vaccination in 2022. Over the past decade, two essential elements have been identified to maintain the goal of polio elimination and that reinforces the importance of sustaining high vaccination coverage: robust epidemiological surveillance systems and a swift response to alerts to protect the vulnerable population and prevent virus reintroduction. In order to achieve eradication, it is crucial to interrupt international transmission and maintain continuous high-quality surveillance and effective coordination across different levels in response to any detection of PV, wild or vaccine derived. This article aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the polio eradication situation in Spain, focusing on the key events that occurred in the last decade and the present and future challenges.

AB In May 2016, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated the cessation of all use of type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2), except for emergency outbreak response. Since then, paralytic polio cases caused by type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses now exceed 3,000 cases reported by 39 countries. In 2022 (as of April 25, 2023), 20 countries reported detection of cases and nine other countries reported environmental surveillance detection, but no reported cases. Recent development of a genetically modified novel type 2 OPV (nOPV2) may help curb the generation of neurovirulent vaccine-derived strains; its use since 2021 under Emergency Use Listing is limited to outbreak response activities. Prior modeling studies showed that the expected trajectory for global type 2 viruses does not appear headed toward eradication, even with the best possible properties of nOPV2 assuming current outbreak response performance. Continued persistence of type 2 poliovirus transmission exposes the world to the risks of potentially high-consequence events such as the importation of virus into high-transmission areas of India or Bangladesh. Building on prior polio endgame modeling and assuming current national and GPEI outbreak response performance, we show no probability of successfully eradicating type 2 polioviruses in the near term regardless of vaccine choice. We also demonstrate the possible worst-case scenarios could result in rapid expansion of paralytic cases and preclude the goal of permanently ending all cases of poliomyelitis in the foreseeable future. Avoiding such catastrophic scenarios will depend on the development of strategies that raise population immunity to type 2 polioviruses.

TI Health and economic consequences of different options for timing the

   serotypes

AB Background: World leaders remain committed to globally-coordinated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation following successful eradication of wild polioviruses, but the best timing and strategy for implementation depend on existing and emerging conditions.
   Methods: Using an existing integrated global poliovirus risk management model, we explore alternatives to the current timing plan of coordinated cessation of each OPV serotype (i.e., OPV1, OPV2, and OPV3 cessation for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). We assume the current timing plan involves OPV2 cessation in 2016 followed by OPV1 and OPV3 cessation in 2019 and we compare this to alternative timing options, including cessation of all three serotypes in 2018 or 2019, and cessation of both OPV2 and OPV3 in 2017 followed by OPV1 in 2019.
   Results: If Supplemtal Immunization Activity frequency remains sufficiently high through cessation of the last OPV serotype, then all OPV cessation timing options prevent circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks after OPV cessation of any serotype. The various OPV cessation timing options result in relatively modest differences in expected vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis cases and expected total of approximately 10-13 billion polio vaccine doses used. However, the expected amounts of vaccine of different OPV formulations needed changes dramatically with each OPV cessation timing option. Overall health economic impacts remain limited for timing options that only change the OPV formulation but preserve the currently planned year for cessation of the last OPV serotype and the global introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) introduction. Earlier cessation of the last OPV serotype or later global IPV introduction yield approximately $1 billion in incremental net benefits due to saved vaccination costs, although the logistics of implementation of OPV cessation remain uncertain and challenging.
   Conclusions: All countries should maintain the highest possible levels of population immunity to transmission for each poliovirus serotype prior to the coordinated cessation of the OPV serotype to manage cVDPV risks. If OPV2 cessation gets delayed, then global health leaders should consider other OPV cessation timing options.

AB Background. India presented many challenges to the global effort to eliminate the transmission of wild polioviruses (WPVs) and poliomyelitis, with the last case of WPV type 2 in the world reported in northern India in 1999 and WPV types 1 and 3 circulating until early 2011.
   Methods.aEuro integral We used a differential equation-based model to characterize the dynamics of poliovirus transmission and various opportunities to increase and maintain high population immunity to poliovirus transmission for 2 high-risk areas in northern India. We explored options that India probably considered before 2011, to demonstrate the impact of strategies to accelerate WPV elimination and sustain high population immunity. We also characterized the impact of current and potential future vaccination strategies and explored the potential trade-offs associated with the various strategies.
   Results.aEuro integral National immunization policy choices impact population immunity, which leads to different numbers of expected paralytic cases and risks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks. Assuming that India maintains high vaccination intensity everywhere, we do not anticipate issues with outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 infection following globally coordinated cessation of type 2-containting oral poliovirus vaccine use. We find a relatively modest potential role for inactivated poliovirus vaccine.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral National policy makers should consider the impacts of their vaccine choices on population immunity to poliovirus transmission.

   controlled trial
SO LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH

AB Background Pakistan faces huge challenges in eradicating polio due to widespread poliovirus transmission and security challenges. Innovative interventions are urgently needed to strengthen community buy-in, to increase the coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and other routine immunisations, and to enhance immunity through the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in combination with OPV. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effect on immunisation coverage of an integrated strategy for community engagement and maternal and child health immunisation campaigns in insecure and conflict-affected polio-endemic districts of Pakistan.
   Methods We did a community-based three-arm cluster randomised trial in healthy children aged 1 month to 5 years that resided within the study sites in three districts of Pakistan at high risk of polio. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using restricted randomisation in blocks of 20 by an external statistician (1: 1: 1) to receive routine polio programme activities (control, arm A), additional interventions with community outreach and mobilisation using an enhanced communication package and provision of short-term preventive maternal and child health services and routine immunisation (health camps), including OPV (arm B), or all interventions of arm B with additional provision of IPV delivered at the maternal and child health camps (arm C). An independent team conducted surveys at baseline, endline, and after each round of supplementary immunisation activity for acceptability and effect. The primary outcome measures for the study were coverage of OPV, IPV, and routine extended programme on immunisation vaccines and changes in the proportion of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated children. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01908114.
   Findings Between June 4, 2013, and May 31, 2014, 387 clusters were randomised (131 to arm A, 127 to arm B, and 129 to arm C). At baseline, 28 760 children younger than 5 years were recorded in arm A, 30 098 in arm B, and 29 126 in arm C. 359 clusters remained in the trial until the end (116 in arm A, 120 in arm B, and 123 in arm C; with 23 334 children younger than 5 years in arm A, 26 110 in arm B, and 25 745 in arm C). The estimated OPV coverage was 75% in arm A compared with 82% in arm B (difference vs arm A 6.6%; 95% CI 4.8-8.3) and 84% in arm C (8.5%, 6.8-10.1; overall p<0.0001). The mean proportion of routine vaccine doses received by children younger than 24 months of age was 43% in arm A, 52% in arm B (9%, 7-11) and 54% in arm C (11%, 9-13; overall p<0.0001). No serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation were reported after immunisation.
   Interpretation Despite the challenges associated with the polio end-game in high-risk, conflict-affected areas of Pakistan, a strategy of community mobilisation and targeted community-based health and immunisation camps during polio immunisation campaigns was successful in increasing vaccine coverage, including polio vaccine coverage.

AB Background: Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is now the only source of routine type 2 protection. The relationship, if any, between vaccine-induced type 2 humoral and intestinal immunity is poorly understood.
   Methods: Two clinical trials in five Latin American countries of mixed or sequential bOPV-IPV schedules in 1640 infants provided data on serum neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and intestinal immunity, assessed as viral shedding following oral mOPV2 challenge. Analyses with generalized additive and quantile regression models examined the relationships between prechallenge NAb titers and proportion, duration and titers (magnitude) of viral shedding.
   Results: We found a statistically significant (p<.0001) but weak relationship between NAb titer at the time of mOPV2 challenge and the Shedding Index Endpoint, the mean log(10) stool viral titer over 4 post-challenge assessments. Day 28 post-challenge shedding was 13.4% (8.1%, 18.8%) lower and the Day 21 post-challenge median titer of shed virus was 3.10 log(10) (2.21, 3.98) lower for subjects with NAb titers at the ULOQ as compared with LLOQ on day of challenge. Overall, there was a weak but significant negative relationship, with high NAb titers associated with lower rates of viral shedding, an effect supported by subset analysis to elucidate between-country differences.
   Conclusions: Taken alone, the weak association between pre-challenge NAb titers following IPV or mixed/sequential bOPV/IPV immunization and differences in intestinal immunity is insufficient to predict polio type 2 intestinal immunity; even very high titers may not preclude viral shedding. Further research is needed to identify predictive markers of intestinal immunity in the context of global OPV cessation and IPV-only immunization. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since "Global Polio Eradication Initiative" was launched by World Health Assembly in 1988, the incidence rate of polio has been reduced by more than 99%, and the whole world has entered a post polio era nowadays. China has been a polio free status recognized by World Health Organization for 22 years and most people believe that no more public health concerns need to be given. How is the population of polio survivors in China? What strategies of health economics and actions of public health for those with polio are ethically appropriate? This article, first of all, deeply summarizes and analyzes the history, current situation and unmet needs of population with polio sequelae and post-polio syndrome in China, and then, puts forward important issues faced by polio survivors who natural infected and who due to vaccine associated paralytic polio and vaccine derived poliovirus. The management of polio survivor is not only a medical and rehabilitation problem involving accessibility, accommodations, but also a public health issue, and most importantly, an ethical concern. Furthermore, from the perspective of ethics such as Justice and Cooperation, the author demonstrates the rationality and necessity of continuing to pay more attention to polio sequela cases at this stage in China. Finally, many valuable suggestions and practical recommendations are given.

AB OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to quantitatively assess the general public's awareness, attitude and perception of polio and its vaccination in Peshawar KPK, Pakistan.
   METHODS: We conducted a survey-based study to understand the surge in polio cases from 2015 to 2019 in the Peshawar city of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. A pre-tested questionnaire-based study was conducted in 2019 to assess the attitude and general perception of residents of Peshawar KPK towards polio vaccination.
   RESULTS: Out of 241 country-wide polio cases, 63 (26.1%) polio cases were reported in Peshawar city from 2015-2019. The questionnaire revealed that individuals between 18-30 years of age had sufficient knowledge (65.1%) about polio. Male and female participants had equal awareness (similar to 43%). Participants with higher education (45.9%), those with better financial status (49.5%), individuals with children < 5 years of age (46.4%), and those who had experience of a polio patient (63.1%) had better knowledge. Participants inhabiting the central city were better aware (50.5%) of polio than individuals living in the outskirts.
   CONCLUSION: The data indicated that poor knowledge and negative attitudes of people towards polio vaccination are the main causes of the polio eradication program's failure. Moreover, religious beliefs, unchecked migration between the Pak-Afghan border, and lack of knowledge about polio vaccination are identified as critical barriers to polio eradication.

TI Impact of national immunization days on polio-related knowledge and
   practice of urban women in Bangladesh
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS; ERADICATION
AB Bangladesh began to hold National Immunization Days (NIDs) from 1995 as part of the country's goat to eradicate poliomyelitis by the turn of the century. The NIDs brought together government agencies, the media, voluntary organisations and individual volunteers in social mobilization and service delivery activities. This paper assesses the impact of the first two polio NIDs in terms of the immunization coverage and change in knowledge about the disease among women living in Dhaka city, the capital of the country. Data were collected through pre-and post-NID cross-sectional surveys in a sample of one area of Dhaka city which included slum and non-slum households. Knowledge data were collected from 525 women with at least one child aged less than five years. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage during NIDs was obtained from 720 children. Knowledge of polio as a vaccine preventable disease increased after NIDs among both slum and non-slum women. The knowledge gap between the two groups was significantly reduced. Field workers, who regularly visit women at their homes to promote health and family planning services, were the main source of information for the slum women while television was cited as the most important source of information by non-slum women. The study revealed that 88% of children under five years received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) during NIDs, and 67% received two stipulated doses with no significant differences between slum (65%) and non-slum (69%) groups. In addition, 68% of the children contacted during the NIDs were given vitamin A supplementation. The study suggests that strategies like NID can be effectively used to tap into community resources and to generate political commitments for health programmes.

TI Updated Characterization of Post-OPV Cessation Risks: Lessons from 2019
   Serotype 2 Outbreaks and Implications for the Probability of OPV Restart
SO RISK ANALYSIS
LA English

AB After the globally coordinated cessation of any serotype of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), some risks remain from undetected, existing homotypic OPV-related transmission and/or restarting transmission due to several possible reintroduction risks. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of serotype 2-containing OPV (OPV2) in 2016. Following OPV2 cessation, the GPEI and countries implemented activities to withdraw all the remaining trivalent OPV, which contains all three poliovirus serotypes (i.e., 1, 2, and 3), from the supply chain and replace it with bivalent OPV (containing only serotypes 1 and 3). However, as of early 2020, monovalent OPV2 use for outbreak response continues in many countries. In addition, outbreaks observed in 2019 demonstrated evidence of different types of risks than previously modeled. We briefly review the 2019 epidemiological experience with serotype 2 live poliovirus outbreaks and propose a new risk for unexpected OPV introduction for inclusion in global modeling of OPV cessation. Using an updated model of global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution with and without consideration of this new risk, we explore the implications of the current global situation with respect to the likely need to restart preventive use of OPV2 in OPV-using countries. Simulation results without this new risk suggest OPV2 restart will likely need to occur (81% of 100 iterations) to manage the polio endgame based on the GPEI performance to date with existing vaccine tools, and with the new risk of unexpected OPV introduction the expected OPV2 restart probability increases to 89%. Contingency planning requires new OPV2 bulk production, including genetically stabilized OPV2 strains.

AB Objectives: To demonstrate the immunity status of children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NP AFP) reported through the AFP surveillance system in the South South region of Nigeria.
   Study design: A retrospective study was conducted using AFP surveillance data collected routinely between January 2011 and December 2014 by the Disease Surveillance Department of the regional health service and the World Health Organization (WHO)-accredited regional reference polio laboratory. All cases of AFP reported to the Disease Surveillance Network from all six zones during this period were included in the study.
   Methods: In total, 5111 cases of AFP in children aged <= 15 years were reported between 2011 and 2014. These cases were investigated and verified by WHO surveillance officers using a standard questionnaire, which captured the number of doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) received by the child. Two stool samples were collected for each case, 24-48 h apart, within 14 days of the onset of paralysis, and transported to the national polio laboratory under reverse cold chain storage. Data retrieved were stored in an AFP database hosted by the WHO server. EPIINFO software was used to query the database and extract the information required for analysis in this study.
   Results: The percentage of children who had received at least three doses of OPV (which serves as a threshold to measure immunity status) decreased from 87% in 2011 to 82% in 2014. The percentage of children who had not received any doses of OPV decreased from 2% in 2011 to 1% in 2014. Forty-eight percent of the children who had not received any doses of OPV were aged <1 year.
   Conclusion: Given the decrease in OPV immunity status, the region risks re-introduction of poliovirus. Swift steps should be taken to improve the immunization coverage, which would boost immunity status in Nigeria. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the very low, but nonzero, paralysis risks associated with the use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), eradicating poliomyelitis requires ending all OPV use globally. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated cessation of Sabin type 2 OPV (OPV2 cessation) in 2016, except for emergency outbreak response. However, as of early 2023, plans for cessation of bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3 OPV) remain undefined, and OPV2 use for outbreak response continues due to ongoing transmission of type 2 polioviruses and reported type 2 cases. Recent development and use of a genetically stabilized novel type 2 OPV (nOPV2) leads to additional potential vaccine options and increasing complexity in strategies for the polio endgame. Prior applications of integrated global risk, economic, and poliovirus transmission modeling consistent with GPEI strategic plans that preceded OPV2 cessation explored OPV cessation dynamics and the evaluation of options to support globally coordinated risk management efforts. The 2022-2026 GPEI strategic plan highlighted the need for early bOPV cessation planning. We review the published modeling and explore bOPV cessation immunization options as of 2022, assuming that the GPEI partners will not support restart of the use of any OPV type in routine immunization after a globally coordinated cessation of such use. We model the potential consequences of globally coordinating bOPV cessation in 2027, as anticipated in the 2022-2026 GPEI strategic plan. We do not find any options for bOPV cessation likely to succeed without a strategy of bOPV intensification to increase population immunity prior to cessation.

AB Background The introduction of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) represents a crucial step in the polio eradication endgame. This trial examined the safety and immunogenicity of IPV given alongside the measles-rubella and yellow fever vaccines at 9 months and when given as a full or fractional dose using needle and syringe or disposable-syringe jet injector.
   Methods We did a phase 4, randomised, non-inferiority trial at three periurban government clinics in west Gambia. Infants aged 9-10 months who had already received oral poliovirus vaccine were randomly assigned to receive the IPV, measles-rubella, and yellow fever vaccines, singularly or in combination. Separately, IPV was given as a full intramuscular or fractional intradermal dose by needle and syringe or disposable-syringe jet injector at a second visit. The primary outcomes were seroprevalence rates for poliovirus 4-6 weeks post-vaccination and the rate of seroconversion between baseline and post-vaccination serum samples for measles, rubella, and yellow fever; and the post-vaccination antibody titres generated against each component of the vaccines. We did a per-protocol analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 10% for poliovirus seroprevalence and measles, rubella, and yellow fever seroconversion, and (1/3) log(2) for log(2)-transformed antibody titres. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01847872.
   Findings Between July 10, 2013, and May 8, 2014, we assessed 1662 infants for eligibility, of whom 1504 were enrolled into one of seven groups for vaccine interference and one of four groups for fractional dosing and alternative route of administration. The rubella and yellow fever antibody titres were reduced by co-administration but the seroconversion rates achieved non-inferiority in both cases (rubella, -4.5% [95% CI-9.5 to -0.1]; yellow fever, 1.2% [-2.9 to 5.5]). Measles and poliovirus responses were unaffected (measles, 6.8% [95% CI -1.4 to 14.9]; poliovirus serotype 1, 1.6% [-6.7 to 4.7]; serotype 2, 0.0% [-2.1 to 2.1]; serotype 3, 0.0% [-3.8 to 3.9]). Poliovirus seroprevalence was universally high (> 97%) after vaccination, but the antibody titres generated by fractional intradermal doses of IPV did not achieve non-inferiority compared with full dose. The number of infants who seroconverted or had a four-fold rise in titres was also lower by the intradermal route. There were no safety concerns.
   Interpretation The data support the future co-administration of IPV, measles-rubella, and yellow fever vaccines within the Expanded Programme on Immunization schedule at 9 months. The administration of single fractional intradermal doses of IPV by needle and syringe or disposable-syringe jet injector compromises the immunity generated, although it results in a high post-vaccination poliovirus seroprevalence.

TI Risk Assessments for Type 1 Wild Poliovirus and Type 2 Vaccine-Derived
   Poliovirus Importation and Transmission - China, 2023
SO CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
ID MONITORING AUTOPHAGY; GUIDELINES; ASSAYS
AB Introduction: All countries face the potential threat of imported polioviruses, including both wild type and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. In response, we conducted a province-level assessment in China to evaluate the risk of importation and transmission of type 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2). Methods: Distinct risk assessment tools for WPV1 and VDPV2 were employed, incorporating three primary indicators - population immunity, poliovirus surveillance, and importation risk. WPV1 was assessed using 13 secondary indicators, whereas VDPV2 utilized 21 secondary indicators. Assessments used comprehensive provincial data from the preceding five years. Scores (S-values) were derived from the secondary indicators' criteria and ratings, and used to classify the provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) into three risk categories: high, medium, and low. The top 10% of PLADs were designated as high- risk, with the remaining provinces equally distributed into medium- and low-risk categories. Results: In 2023, Xizang, Qinghai, and Xinjiang PLADs faced the highest risk of WPV1 importation and transmission; Xizang, Shaanxi, and Hainan PLADs were at the greatest risk for VDPV2 importation and transmission. Conclusions: Risk assessment for VDPV2 importation and transmission has identified a distinct set of high-risk provinces compared to those identified by WPV1 risk assessment. Preventive and proactive response measures tailored to the specific risks should be implemented to maintain China's polio-free status.

AB Poliomyelitis is a crippling viral disease caused by poliovirus, a positive-stranded RNA virus that is a serotype of Enterovirus C. Pakistan remains one of the countries in the world where poliomyelitis is still prevalent, posing an obstacle to global poliomyelitis eradication. With the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, polio eradication campaigns have proven less feasible, resulting in an increase in polio cases across the country. Pakistan's healthcare system and socio-economic framework are incapable of dealing with two deadly viruses at the same time. As a result, effective measures for combating the destruction caused by the spread of the poliovirus are required.

AB Background. In July 2013, Israel was swept with fear of a polio outbreak. In response to the importation of wild polio virus, the Ministry decided to take preventive action by administering oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to all children born after 1 January 2004 who had received at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the past. This study analyzes the vaccination uptake rates resulting from the mass polio vaccination campaign on the basis of health inequality parameters of socioeconomic status (SES), principles of solidarity, and the Gini inequality index. The research explores understanding the value of the Gini inequality index within the context of SES and solidarity.
   Methods. The study is based on data gathered from the Israeli Ministry of Health's administrative records from mother-and-child clinics across Israel. The research population is comprised of resident infants and children whom the Ministry of Health defined as eligible for the OPV between August and December 2013 (the "campaign period"). The analysis was carried out at the municipality level as well as the statistical area level.
   Results. The higher the SES level of the municipality where the mother-and-child clinic is located, the lower the OPV vaccination uptake is. The greater the income inequality is in the municipality where the mother-and-child clinic is situated, the lower the vaccination uptake.
   Conclusions. Public health professionals promoting vaccine programs need to make specially-designed efforts both in localities with high average income and in localities with a high level of income diversity/inequality. Such practice will better utilize funds, resources, and manpower dedicated to increasing vaccination uptake across varying populations and communities.

AB Background: One of the challenges facing the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is efficiently directing limited resources, such as specially trained personnel, community outreach activities, and satellite vaccinator tracking, to the most at-risk areas to maximize the impact of interventions. A validated predictive model of wild poliovirus circulation would greatly inform prioritization efforts by accurately forecasting areas at greatest risk, thus enabling the greatest effect of program interventions.
   Methods: Using Nigerian acute flaccid paralysis surveillance data from 2004-2013, we developed a spatial hierarchical Poisson hurdle model fitted within a Bayesian framework to study historical polio caseload patterns and forecast future circulation of type 1 and 3 wild poliovirus within districts in Nigeria. A Bayesian temporal smoothing model was applied to address data sparsity underlying estimates of covariates at the district level.
   Results: We find that calculated vaccine-derived population immunity is significantly negatively associated with the probability and number of wild poliovirus case(s) within a district. Recent case information is significantly positively associated with probability of a case, but not the number of cases. We used lagged indicators and coefficients from the fitted models to forecast reported cases in the subsequent six-month periods. Over the past three years, the average predictive ability is 86 +/- 2% and 85 +/- 4% for wild poliovirus type 1 and 3, respectively. Interestingly, the predictive accuracy of historical transmission patterns alone is equivalent (86 +/- 2% and 84 +/- 4% for type 1 and 3, respectively). We calculate uncertainty in risk ranking to inform assessments of changes in rank between time periods.
   Conclusions: The model developed in this study successfully predicts districts at risk for future wild poliovirus cases in Nigeria. The highest predicted district risk was 12.8 WPV1 cases in 2006, while the lowest district risk was 0.001 WPV1 cases in 2013. Model results have been used to direct the allocation of many different interventions, including political and religious advocacy visits. This modeling approach could be applied to other vaccine preventable diseases for use in other control and elimination programs.

AB Objectives: The emergence of human pathogens with pandemic potential motivates rapid vaccine development. We explore the role of vaccines in control and eradication of a novel emerging pathogen.
   Methods: We hypothetically simulate emergence of a novel wild poliovirus (nWPV) in 2020 assuming an immunologically naive population. Assuming different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), we explore the impacts of vaccines resembling serotype-specific oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), novel OPV (nOPV), or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).
   Results: Vaccines most effectively change the trajectory of an emerging disease when disseminated early, rapidly, and widely in the background of ongoing strict NPIs, unless the NPIs successfully eradicate the emerging pathogen before it establishes endemic transmission. Without strict NPIs, vaccines primarily reduce the burden of disease in the remaining susceptible individuals and in new birth cohorts. Live virus vaccines that effectively compete with the nWPVs can reduce disease burdens more than other vaccines. When relaxation of existing NPIs occurs at the time of vaccine introduction, nWPV transmission can counterintuitively increase in the short term.
   Conclusions: Vaccines can increase the probability of disease eradication in the context of strict NPIs. However, successful eradication will depend on specific immunization strategies used and a global commitment to eradication.

AB BackgroundKano is one of the high-risk states for polio transmission in Northern Nigeria. The state reported more cases of wild polioviruses (WPVs) than any other state in the country. The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2013 indicated that OPV3 coverage in the routine immunization (RI) programmewas 57.9%. Additionally, serial polio seroprevalence studies conducted from 2011 to 2015 in the eightmetropolitan LGAs indicated low immunity levels against all three polio serotypes in children below one year. Areas with sub-optimal RI coverage such as Kanothat fail to remove all tOPV during the tOPV-bOPV switchwill be at increased risk of VDPV2 circulation.MethodsWe assessed the impact of political leadership engagement in mobilizing other stakeholders on the outcomes of the bOPV-tOPV switch in Kano State from February to May 2016 using nationally-selected planning and outcome indicators.ResultsA total of 670 health facilities that provide RI services were assessed during the pre-switch activities. Health workers were aware of the switch exercise in 520 (95.1%) of the public health facilities assessed. It was found that health workers knew what to do should tOPV be found in any of the 521 (95.2%)public health facilities assessed. However, there was a wide disparity between the public and private health practitioners' knowledge on basic concepts of the switch.There was 100% withdrawal of tOPV from the state and the seven zonal cold stores. Unmarked tOPVwas found in the cold chain system in 2 (4.5%) LGAs. Only one health facility (0.8%) had tOPV in the cold chain. No tOPVwas identified outside the cold chain without the Do not use sticker in any of the health facilities.ConclusionThe engagement of the political leadership to mobilize other key stakeholders facilitated successful implementation of the tOPV-bOPVswitch exercise and provided opportunity to strengthen partnerships with the private health sector in Kano State.

ID UNITED-STATES; PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS; DISEASE
AB Objective: To provide evidence according to the requirements of the Global Commission for Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication that poliomyelitis has been eliminated in Australia.
   Methods: Documentation of the surveillance of poliomyelitis, the presence of a comprehensive national immunisation program, and a network of laboratories for viral diagnosis. Active surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases was initiated in 1995 to prove that poliovirus does not cause such paralysis. Australia is also evaluating the surveillance of AFP through a retrospective hospital based study.
   Results: The last case in Australia of polio due to wild poliovirus was seen in 1978 and the last case of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis detected by serology was in 1994. The latest immunisation coverage figures for OPV3 for children under one year of age is 85.6%. The Australian National Polio Reference Laboratory has tested 821 enteroviruses since 1994 and have not identified any wild poliovirus. The average rate of non-polio AFP based on 111 cases investigated for the period 1995-98 is 0.71 per 100,000 under the age of 15 years. Stool samples were collected from only 21% of cases.
   Conclusion: The process of certification of the eradication of poliomyelitis in Australia is almost complete. Although immunisation coverage is high, improvement in AFP surveillance and stool collection is vital for the certification process. The next challenge is the containment of polioviruses.
   Implications: Although Australia and other Western Pacific countries are likely to be certified as wild-polio free in 2000, a comprehensive immunisation program and surveillance must continue for three years after global certification (expected 2003-04).

AB Cuba eliminated polio in 1962 and was among the first countries to do so. Since then, only 20 cases of vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis have been reported. Because Cuba used oral poliovirus vaccine exclusively in two mass campaigns usually in February and April each year, Sabin viruses were detected only within approximately 6-8 weeks after each annual campaign. This made Cuba a very attractive site to study the epidemiology of poliomyelitis in a tropical country without risk of secondary transmission of Sabin viruses for a large part of each year, an advantage over countries that used oral poliovirus vaccine continuously throughout the year in routine immunization programs. This report summarizes the unique scientific collaboration between Cuba's Ministry of Public Health and WHO, with participation by US scientists, in the global effort to eradicate polio.

AB Background Novel oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) was administered in Liberia in response to an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in 2021. We conducted a serological survey of polio antibodies after two national campaigns with nOPV2. Methods This clustered, cross-sectional, population-based seroprevalence survey was conducted in children aged 0-59 months, more than 4 weeks after the second nOPV2 vaccination round. We used a clustered sampling method in four geographical regions of Liberia, followed by a simple random sampling of households. One eligible child was randomly selected per household. Dried blood spot specimens were taken and vaccination history was recorded. The antibody titres against all three poliovirus serotypes were assessed using standard microneutralisation assays done at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, USA. Findings Analysable data were obtained from 436 (87%) of 500 enrolled participants. Of these, 371 (85%) children were reported via parental recall to have received two nOPV2 doses, 43 (10%) received one dose, and 22 (5%) received no doses. The seroprevalence against type 2 poliovirus was 38 & BULL;3% (95% CI 33 & BULL;7-43 & BULL;0; 167 of 436 participants). No significant difference was observed between type 2 seroprevalence in children aged 6 months or older who were reported to have received two doses of nOPV2 (42 & BULL;1%, 95% CI 36 & BULL;8-47 & BULL;5; 144 of 342), one dose (28 & BULL;0%, 12 & BULL;1-49 & BULL;4; seven of 25), or no doses (37 & BULL;5%, 8 & BULL;5-75 & BULL;5; three of eight; p=0 & BULL;39). The seroprevalence against type 1 was 59 & BULL;6% (54 & BULL;9-64 & BULL;3; 260 of 436), and the seroprevalence against type 3 was 53 & BULL;0% (48 & BULL;2-57 & BULL;7; 231 of 436). Interpretation Unexpectedly, the data showed low type 2 seroprevalence after two reported doses of nOPV2. This finding is probably affected by the lower oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicity previously demonstrated in resource-limited settings, with high prevalence of chronic intestinal infections in children and other factors discussed herein. Our results provide the first assessment of nOPV2 performance in outbreak response in the African region.

DT Article
DE poliomyelitis; inactivated vaccines; marketing authorization; Eastern
   Mediterranean
AB Background: In 2012, the World Health Assembly declared ending polio a "programmatic emergency for global public health". In response, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative developed "The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018" to address the eradication of all types of poliomyelitis.
   Aims: The World Health Organization invited selected countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to take part in a joint evaluation of the marketing authorization files of candidate standalone inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPVs), aimed to facilitate the evaluation process and expedite the timelines for registration.
   Methods: This report describes the planning, organization and execution of the joint meeting among 6 countries of Eastern Mediterranean Region.
   Results: Participants prepared a joint list of questions and concerns which was shared and discussed with the respective manufacturers on the last day of the review. Manufacturer provided answers to the questions. The questions that could not be responded to immediately by the manufacturer remained to be addressed after the meeting directly between the manufacturer and the national regulatory authoritys. A final joint evaluation report was prepared before the end of the meeting by the participating countries.
   Conclusions: The report focuses on the benefits of the exercise and highlights its shortcomings as a sole strategy to secure the timely registration of the vaccine in target countries. We discuss additional aspects to be addressed to effectively accelerate registration, and hence access to priority vaccines.

AB Background: Oral polio vaccine (OPV) containing attenuated serotype 2 polioviruses was globally withdrawn in 2016, and bivalent OPV (bOPV) containing attenuated serotype 1 and 3 polioviruses needs to be withdrawn after the certification of eradication of all wild polioviruses to eliminate future risks from vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). To minimize risks from VDPVs, the planning and implementation of bOPV withdrawal should build on the experience with withdrawing OPV containing serotype 2 polioviruses while taking into account similarities and differences between the three poliovirus serotypes.
   Methods: We explored the risks from (i) a failure to synchronize OPV cessation and (ii) unauthorized post-cessation OPV use for serotypes 1 and 3 in the context of globally-coordinated future bOPV cessation and compared the results to similar analyses for serotype 2 OPV cessation.
   Results: While the risks associated with a failure to synchronize cessation and unauthorized post-cessation OPV use appear to be substantially lower for serotype 3 polioviruses than for serotype 2 polioviruses, the risks for serotype 1 appear similar to those for serotype 2. Increasing population immunity to serotype 1 and 3 poliovirus transmission using pre-cessation bOPV supplemental immunization activities and inactivated poliovirus vaccine in routine immunization reduces the risks of circulating VDPVs associated with non-synchronized cessation or unauthorized OPV use.
   Conclusions: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative should synchronize global bOPV cessation during a similar window of time as occurred for the global cessation of OPV containing serotype 2 polioviruses and should rigorously verify the absence of bOPV in immunization systems after its cessation.

DE Poliomyelitis; Institut Pasteur; Institut Merieux; Lepine vaccine; OPV;
   Policymaking
AB Poliomyelitis is a disease whose incidence steadily increased during the second half of the twentieth century on both sides of the Atlantic. If in the United States the epidemics which afflicted young children each summer became a major public health issue, in France, polio was considered less pressing than other diseases. This article, based on original archives from the Pasteur and Merieux institutes, analyses the polio control strategies and policies implemented by France from the mid-1950s to the end of the 1960s. The article examines the role of two key actors and institutions that mobilised the French health authorities against the disease: Pierre Lepine and the Institut Pasteur as well as Charles Merieux and the Institut Merieux. Lepine developed an effective injected polio vaccine which was first used before being supplemented with the oral polio vaccine. If the two main protagonists and their institutions worked together, they each implemented different actions and manoeuvres, at different times with the aim to raise awareness of the fight against the disease. The national and international relations of the key French actors were decisive in the development and production of the polio vaccines and their application. This work contributes to understanding processes of polio vaccines choice at the level of national institutions and analyses the political and scientific networks built in support of polio vaccination, to finally move towards compulsory vaccination. Ultimately, this study describes the historical processes by which this disease became conflated with a biotechnology of collective protection in France.

AB Background The global switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in April 2016 without corresponding co-administration of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) until June 2018, created a cohort of poliovirus type 2 naive children with risk of developing vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2). In November and December 2019, two cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were confirmed in quick succession through Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in two nomadic pastoralist settlements in Oti Region. We investigated to determine the outbreak extent, identify risk factors and implement control and preventive measures. Methods We interviewed case-patients' families, abstracted immunization records, assessed AFP surveillance and conducted rapid OPV and IPV vaccination coverage surveys. Using AFP case definition of any child less than 15 years in the community with sudden onset of paralysis from July to November 2019 (in case-patient 1's district) and August to December 2019 (in case-patient 2's district), we conducted active case search. Stool samples from apparently healthy children and close contacts of the case-patients were collected and tested for poliovirus. We conducted environmental assessment of the community to identify potential risk factors. Results Case-patient 1 was an eight-year-old female who had taken two doses of OPV while case-patient 2 was an eight-month-old male who had taken three out of required four OPV doses in addition to IPV at seven months. Families of both case-patients had either travelled to or received visitors from areas with confirmed cVDPV2. Of all children surveyed, eight (29.6%) of 27 and three (18.8%) of 16 eligible children in communities of case-patient 1 and 2 respectively had received required four doses of OPV. No AFP case was found in both communities and surrounding settlements. Both communities had no source of potable water and toilet facilities. A stool sample from a contact of case-patient 1 tested positive for cVDPV2. Conclusion Outbreaks of cVDPV2 occurred in insanitary, under-vaccinated nomadic pastoralist settlements in Oti Region. Three rounds of monovalent OPV vaccination campaigns for children under 5 years of age in the districts and region as well as countrywide IPV vaccination campaign for poliovirus type 2 naive cohort were conducted.

AB We used the clustered lot quality assurance sampling (clustered-LQAS) technique to identify districts with low immunization coverage and guide mop-up actions during the last 4 days of a combined oral polio vaccine (OPV) and yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign conducted in Cameroon in May 2009. We monitored 17 pre-selected districts at risk for low coverage. We designed LQAS plans to reject districts with YF vaccination coverage <90% and with OPV coverage <95%. In each lot the sample size was 50 (five clusters of 10) with decision values of 3 for assessing OPV and 7 for YF coverage. We 'rejected' 10 districts for low YF coverage and 14 for low OPV coverage. Hence we recommended a 2-day extension of the campaign. Clustered-LQAS proved to be useful in guiding the campaign vaccination strategy before the completion of the operations.

AB Every year, large numbers of children are vaccinated against polio during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). Such SIAs have contributed to the > 99% decline in the incidence of poliovirus cases since the beginning of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. It is not clear, however, how much they have also contributed to reducing poverty-related inequalities in access to oral polio vaccine (OPV). We investigated whether the gap in coverage with 3 doses of OPV between children in the poorest and wealthiest households was reduced by SIA participation. To do so, we used data from 25 demographic and health surveys (DHS) conducted in 20 countries since 2002. We found that, in several countries as well as in pooled analyses, poverty-related inequalities in 3-dose OPV coverage were significantly lower among children who had participated in SIAs over the 2 years before a DHS than among other children. SIAs are an important approach to ensuring equitable access to immunization services and possibly other health services.

AB The author analyzes the aftermath of Edward Hooper's suggestion that the trial of an oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the Belgian colonies of Africa engendered the pandemic form of the AIDS virus, HIV-1. In response to Hooper's book, The River(1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to readThe Riveras one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the critical importance of studying The WetNet, a concept coined by the author to name the conceptual and material infrastructures of inter- and intraspecies fluid bonding.

TI Immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose vaccination schedules with
   Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine in China: An open-label,
   randomized, controlled trial
SO LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
LA English
DT Article
DE Inactivated polio vaccine; Seroprevalence; Sabin Strain
ID INFANTS
AB Background: We assessed immunogenicity of three-dose and two-dose immunization schedules with a Sabin-strain inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) produced by one Chinese vaccine manufacturer.
   Methods: This was an open label, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 16 vaccination clinics in Shandong province. Infants were allocated randomly to either a 3-dose study arm (sIPV administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age) or a 2-dose arm (sIPV administered at 4 and 8-11 months of age). Poliovirus neutralizing antibodies were measured in sera collected prior to the first sIPV dose and one month after the last dose.
   Findings: We enrolled 560 infants; 536 (95.7%) completed the study. Final seropositivity rates were >98% for all three serotypes in both study arms. There were no statistically significant differences in seropositivity between the 2-dose and the 3-dose schedule. Final median reciprocal titres of polio antibodies were high overall (>1:768 for all serotypes) and statistically significantly higher in 2-dose recipients compared with 3-dose recipients (p < 0.001).
   Interpretation: This study offers evidence that two doses of sIPV administered at 4 and 8-11 months of age and three doses of sIPV administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age both provide serological protection against poliomyelitis. Median reciprocal titres of polio antibodies were high overall, and were more related to the interval between doses than the number of doses, with the longer interval of the 2-dose schedule producing higher reciprocal titres than the shorter-interval 3-dose schedule. The protection provided by the 3-dose schedule is achieved earlier in life than the protection with the 2-dose schedule. Countries planning to use an IPV-only schedule in the post-eradication era can consider this 2-dose sIPV option as an immunogenic and dose-sparing strategy. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Listening to the rumours: What the northern Nigeria polio vaccine

AB In 2003 five northern Nigerian states boycotted the oral polio vaccine due to fears that it was unsafe. Though the international responses have been scrutinised in the literature, this paper argues that lessons still need to be learnt from the boycott: that the origins and continuation of the boycott were due to specific local factors. We focus mainly on Kano state, which initiated the boycotts and continued to reject immunisations for the longest period, to provide a focused analysis of the internal dynamics and complex multifaceted causes of the boycott. We argue that the delay in resolving the year-long boycott was largely due to the spread of rumours at local levels, which were intensified by the outspoken involvement of high-profile individuals whose views were misunderstood or underestimated. We use sociological concepts to analyse why these men gained influence amongst northern Nigerian communities. This study has implications on contemporary policy: refusals still challenge the Global Polio Eradication Initiative; and polio remains endemic to Nigeria (Nigeria accounted for over half of global cases in 2012). This paper sheds light on how this problem may be tackled with the ultimate aim of vaccinating more children and eradicating polio.

AB Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only countries where polio is endemic, and Pakistan reports the most cases in the world. Although the rate is lower than in previous years, the situation remains alarming. We conducted a mixed methods study in high-risk areas of Pakistan to identify knowledge, attitudes, and practices of target populations about polio vaccine and its eradication, and to estimate coverage of routine immunization and oral polio vaccine. We surveyed 10,685 households in Karachi, 2522 in Pishin, and 2005 in Bajaur. Some knowledge of polio is universal, but important misconceptions persist. The findings of this study carry strategic importance for program direction and implementation.

AB In August 2013, a nationwide vaccination campaign with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) was initiated after isolation of wild-type poliovirus type 1 (WPV-1) in routine sewage surveillance in Israel. The campaign started in the Southern district and later extended to the entire country. This study examined the association between socioeconomic status (SES), and compliance with bOPV vaccine during the campaign. Nationwide data relating to SES by geographical cluster were correlated with vaccine coverage rates in the same areas. All analyses were conducted separately for Jews and Arabs. Coverage with the bOPV vaccination campaign in the Arab population (92.4%) was higher than in the Jewish population (59.2%). This difference was consistently present in all SES clusters. In the Jewish population there was an inverse correlation between SES and vaccination coverage rates (R = -0.93, P < 0.001). Lower vaccination coverage with supplemental vaccine activities in higher SES groups is a challenge that needs to be addressed in future public health events and emergencies in order to achieve satisfactory protection rates for the public.

AB Introduction: Pakistan is one of only three poliomyelitis-endemic countries in the world. Twelve wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were recorded in the country in 2018. Even though resistance to oral polio vaccine (OPV) has decreased over time, there are still pockets of communities, mostly ethnic Pakhtun living in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, that resist OPV. Although local journalists may be important sources of health information, past studies have overlooked their role in this context. The purpose of this study was to examine Pakhtun health journalists' beliefs regarding OPV and their views of the barriers and facilitators that influence OPV acceptance or hesitancy in their communities.
   Methods: We recruited and interviewed 33 Pakhtun journalists covering health issues for diverse media outlets in high-risk districts for WPV of the KP province. The semi-structured interviews were translated, transcribed, and analyzed for themes.
   Results: The participants strongly supported OPV and advocated that children in their own families and communities get vaccinated against polio. At the same time, they felt that their communities faced more urgent health needs that were not addressed by the government. They identified barriers at the media organizational level operating against accurate coverage of OPV, including financial and time constraints, a lack of checks and balances, and limited health literacy. They regarded press releases issued by the officials associated with OPV campaigns as the main facilitators in the coverage of OPV. The participants perceived lack of community trust in the government, security concerns, and community members' religious beliefs as the major impediments to increase in uptake of OPV.
   Conclusion: Pakhtun health journalists have the potential to be important partners in national polio eradication initiatives. They should receive culturally sensitive training in local languages at appropriate literacy levels. We also suggest direct involvement of journalists in community mobilization efforts.

TI Maintaining the Region of the Americas free of polio: best practices for

AB The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and its Member States have been leading the efforts to eradicate wild poliovirus in the Region of Americas since smallpox's successful elimination in 1971. The region became the first to be certified free of wild poliovirus in 1994. However, in July 2022, an unvaccinated patient with no recent travel history was diagnosed with poliomyelitis in the United States of America. In response to the emergence of a circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus in the United States, PAHO established the Polio Incident Management Support Team. This team has been coordinating response efforts, focusing on: coordination, planning, and monitoring; risk communication and community engagement; surveillance and case investigation; vaccination; and rapid response. In this paper, we identified and documented best practices observed following establishment of the Incident Management Support Team (September 2022-2023) through a comprehensive review and analysis of various data sources and country -specific data from the polio surveillance dashboard. The aim was to share these best practices, highlighting technical support and implementation of polio measures by Member States. Despite several challenges, the Americas region remains polio -free. Polio risk is declining, with a July 2023 assessment showing fewer countries at medium, high, and very high risk. This progress reflects improved immunization coverage, surveillance, containment, health determinants, and outbreak preparedness and response. The PAHO Polio Incident Management Support Team has played a key role in supporting these efforts.

AB Background. In 2009, enhanced poliovirus surveillance was established in polio-endemic areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India, to assess poliovirus infection in older individuals.
   Methods.aEuro integral In Uttar Pradesh, stool specimens from asymptomatic household and neighborhood contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed polio were tested for polioviruses. In Bihar, in community-based surveillance, children and adults from 250 randomly selected households in the Kosi River area provided stool and pharyngeal swab samples that were tested for polioviruses. A descriptive analysis of surveillance data was performed.
   Results.aEuro integral In Uttar Pradesh, 89 of 1842 healthy contacts of case patients with polio (4.8%) were shedding wild poliovirus (WPV); 54 of 85 (63.5%) were a parts per thousand yen5 years of age. Shedding was significantly higher in index households than in neighborhood households (P < .05). In Bihar, 11 of 451 healthy persons (2.4%) were shedding WPV in their stool; 6 of 11 (54.5%) were a parts per thousand yen5 years of age. Mean viral titer was similar in older and younger children.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral A high proportion of persons a parts per thousand yen5 years of age were asymptomatically shedding polioviruses. These findings provide indirect evidence that older individuals could have contributed to community transmission of WPV in India. Polio vaccination campaigns generally target children < 5 years of age. Expanding this target age group in polio-endemic areas could accelerate polio eradication.

AB Background. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) results in an ongoing burden of poliomyelitis due to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). This motivates globally coordinated OPV cessation after wild poliovirus eradication.
   Methods.aEuro integral We modeled poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution to characterize the interaction between population immunity, OPV-related virus prevalence, and the emergence of cVDPVs after OPV cessation. We explored strategies to prevent and manage cVDPVs for countries that currently use OPV for immunization and characterized cVDPV emergence risks and OPV use for outbreak response.
   Results.aEuro integral Continued intense supplemental immunization activities until OPV cessation represent the best strategy to prevent cVDPV emergence after OPV cessation in areas with insufficient routine immunization coverage. Policy makers must actively manage population immunity before OPV cessation to prevent cVDPVs and aggressively respond if prevention fails. Sufficiently aggressive response with OPV to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV outbreak virus will lead to die-out of OPV-related viruses used for response in the outbreak population. Further analyses should consider the risk of exportation to other populations of the outbreak virus and any OPV used for outbreak response.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral OPV cessation can successfully eliminate all circulating live polioviruses in a population. The polio end game requires active risk management.

ID RISK
AB In December 1996 three children were reported to have died and several others had fallen ill after being administered the oral polio vaccine (OPV) at the first phase of the Pulse Polio Immunisation (PPI) campaign. The authors examine the blame assigning discourses in this context. While attempting to map the varied and plural memories of the event on the registers of the media, the state and the community, ail attempt is made to understand the nature of blame and accusation encountered within each of these registers.

AB The history of polio vaccination in the United States spans 50 years and includes different phases of the disease, multiple vaccines, and a sustained significant commitment of resources. We estimated cost-effectiveness ratios and assessed the net benefits of polio vaccination applicable at various points in time from the societal perspective and we discounted these back to appropriate points in time. We reconstructed vaccine price data from available sources and used these to retrospectively estimate the total costs of the U.S. historical polio vaccination strategies (all costs reported in year 2002 dollars). We estimate that the United States invested approximately $35 billion (1955 net present value, discount rate of 3%) in polio vaccines between 1955 and 2005 and will invest approximately $1.4 billion (1955 net present value, or $6.3 billion in 2006 net present value) between 2006 and 2015 assuming a policy of continued use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for routine vaccination. The historical and future investments translate into over 1.7 billion vaccinations that prevent approximately 1.1 million cases of paralytic polio and over 160,000 deaths (1955 net present values of approximately 480,000 cases and 73,000 deaths). Due to treatment cost savings, the investment implies net benefits of approximately $180 billion (1955 net present value), even without incorporating the intangible costs of suffering and death and of averted fear. Retrospectively, the U.S. investment in polio vaccination represents a highly valuable, cost-saving public health program. Observed changes in the cost-effectiveness ratio estimates over time suggest the need for living economic models for interventions that appropriately change with time. This article also demonstrates that estimates of cost-effectiveness ratios at any single time point may fail to adequately consider the context of the investment made to date and the importance of population and other dynamics, and shows the importance of dynamic modeling.

AB The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners engaged modelers during the past nearly 20 years to support strategy and policy discussions and decisions, and to provide estimates of the risks, costs, and benefits of different options for managing the polio endgame. Limited efforts to date provided insights related to the validation of the models used for GPEI strategy and policy decisions. However, modeling results only influenced decisions in some cases, with other factors carrying more weight in many key decisions. In addition, the results from multiple modeling groups do not always agree, which supports selection of some strategies and/or policies counter to the recommendations from some modelers but not others. This analysis reflects on our modeling, and summarizes our premises and recommendations, the outcomes of these recommendations, and the implications of key limitations of models with respect to polio endgame strategy. We briefly review the current state of the GPEI given epidemiological experience as of early 2020, which includes failure of the GPEI to deliver on the objectives of its 2013-2018 strategic plan despite full financial support. Looking ahead, we provide context for why the GPEI strategy of global oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation to end all cases of poliomyelitis looks infeasible given the current state of the GPEI and the failure to successfully stop all transmission of serotype 2 live polioviruses within four years of the April-May 2016 coordinated cessation of serotype 2 OPV use in routine immunization.

AB Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988 the global incidence of poliomyelitis has fallen by nearly 99 %. From a situation where wild type poliovirus was endemic in 125 countries across five continents, transmission is now limited to regions of just three countries - Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. A sharp increase in Pakistan's poliomyelitis cases in 2014 prompted the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee to declare the situation a 'public health emergency of international concern'. Global polio eradication hinges on Pakistan's ability to address the religious, political and socioeconomic barriers to immunisation; including discrepancies in vaccine coverage, a poor health infrastructure, and conflict in polio-endemic regions of the country. This analysis provides an overview of the GPEI, focusing on the historical and contemporary challenges facing Pakistan's polio eradication programme and the impact of conflict and insecurity, and sheds light on strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy, engage local communities and build on recent progress towards polio eradication in Pakistan.

AB Background Polio antiviral drugs (PAVDs) may provide a critical tool in the eradication endgame by stopping poliovirus infections in immunodeficient individuals who may not clear the virus without therapeutic intervention. Although prolonged/chronic poliovirus excreters are rare, they represent a source of poliovirus reintroduction into the general population. Prior studies that assumed the successful cessation of all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use estimated the potential upper bound of the incremental net benefits (INBs) of resource investments in research and development of PAVDs. However, delays in polio eradication, OPV cessation, and the development of PAVDs necessitate an updated economic analysis to reevaluate the costs and benefits of further investments in PAVDs. Methods Using a global integrated model of polio transmission, immunity, vaccine dynamics, risks, and economics, we explore the risks of reintroduction of polio transmission due to immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV) excreters and reevaluate the upper bound of the INBs of PAVDs. Results Under the current conditions, for which the use of OPV will likely continue for the foreseeable future, even with successful eradication of type 1 wild poliovirus by the end of 2023 and continued use of Sabin OPV for outbreak response, we estimate an upper bound INB of 60 million US$2019. With >100 million US$2019 already invested in PAVD development and with the introduction of novel OPVs that are less likely to revert to neurovirulence, our analysis suggests the expected INBs of PAVDs would not offset their costs. Conclusions While PAVDs could play an important role in the polio endgame, their expected economic benefits drop with ongoing OPV use and poliovirus transmissions. However, stakeholders may pursue the development of PAVDs as a desired product regardless of their economic benefits.

AB Background: In Denmark, data from the childhood vaccination database are used to calculate vaccination coverage (VC) for childhood vaccinations. However, there may be under-reporting in this database. Accurate VC estimates are necessary for adjusting vaccination strategies and providing population-level protection.
   Aims: The main purpose of this study was to validate the reporting of the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and polio (Tdap-IPV) booster in the childhood vaccination database, identify reasons a child was not vaccinated, for the unregistered vaccinations, identify where the vaccination was provided, and to adjust calculations of the VC accordingly.
   Methods: Children registered in the Danish Civil Registry System (residing legally in Denmark) from the 2000 to 2003 birth cohorts without a recorded Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database were randomly selected for this cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study. The adjusted VC in the population was calculated by adding the fraction of the study population registered with the Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database to the fraction of the study population who reported being vaccinated on the questionnaire but who were not register according to the childhood vaccination database.
   Findings: Of the 574 contacted parents, 386 (67%) completed a questionnaire; 272 (70%) reported that their child received the Tdap-IPV booster, with 121 (44%) providing the date of vaccination. Most commonly reported reasons for not receiving the booster included forgetting (37%) and not wanting the vaccination (16%). The majority (89%) of children who received the booster were vaccinated by their general practitioners (GPs); 6% abroad and <1% in a hospital. Using a conservative approach, considering only those who used a vaccination card to answer the questionnaire and who provided an exact data of vaccination, the adjusted Tdap-IPV booster VC was 85.6% (95% CI, 85.1-86.3%) compared to 82% from the childhood vaccination database.
   Conclusion: We identified substantial underreporting of the Tdap-IPV booster in the childhood vaccination database, mainly due to GPs not registering given vaccinations. Validating data used for VC calculations is needed to obtain more precise estimates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Migration-flows pose the risk of poliovirus reintroduction from endemic countries to Greece. This study aims to evaluate serologic-immunity/vaccination against poliomyelitis in newly-arriving migrant children. Methods Demographic-immunisation data and blood-serum were obtained from migrants 1-14years-old, referred to a hospital-clinic in Athens-Greece within three months from arrival. Immunity to polioviruses-1-3 was determined by serum-neutralizing-antibodies(WHO guidelines). Titers >= 1:8 were considered positive. Results From 9/2010 to 9/2013, 274 children(150 refugees/124 immigrants), mean age 7.1years-old, were enrolled. Only 57(20.8%) of them presented with vaccination-records. Children originated mainly from Asia(n = 198), Eastern Europe(n = 28), Middle East(n = 24) and Africa(n = 24) with 160(58.4%) from polio-endemic-countries(Afghanistan-112(40.8%), Pakistan-24(8.8%) and India-24(8.8%)). Seropositivity against polio-1-2&3 was 84.3%, 86.1% and 74.5%, respectively. Immigrants, had higher seroprotective rates against polioviruses-1-2&3 than refugees(polio-1:p = 0.002;polio-2:p = 0.004,polio-3:p < 0.001). Seronegativity to 1PVs-2PVs and all three polio serotypes was found in 37(13.5%),12 (4.4%), and 30 children(10.9%) respectively. Increasing number of vaccine-doses, and younger-age, were positively-associated with seropositivity. Discussion A remarkable fraction of newly-arrived migrant-children were seronegative to one or more polioviruses.

AB Background The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has drastically reduced the global incidence of poliomyelitis since its launch in 1988 thanks to effective vaccines and strong global surveillance systems. However, detections of wild-type as well as vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) still occur, also in the WHO European Region. This study aims to describe the poliovirus detection via the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), clinical enterovirus, and environmental surveillance systems.
   Methods In this study, we review data from annual reports from 2015 to 2022 from the World Health Organization (WHO)'s three core poliovirus surveillance systems in place in the WHO European Region: AFP, clinical enterovirus, and environmental surveillance systems.
   Findings A total of 4324 reported samples were found positive for poliovirus: 477 from AFP surveillance, 394 from clinical surveillance and 3453 from environmental surveillance. Of these, 366 were VDPV, 3952 vaccine strains, and 6 were wild-type poliovirus. 709 were identified as type 1, 399 as type 2, and 1944 type 3, while 1272 samples contained more than one type. Temporal and spatial association of positive environmental samples with positive samples from AFP or clinical enterovirus surveillance was found in only eight countries.
   Interpretation Analysis of poliovirus-positive samples from AFP, clinical enterovirus, and environmental surveillance revealed that type 3 poliovirus was the most prevalent type detected. Most poliovirus-positive samples were identified as vaccine strains. No information on sequences was available.

AB Silent circulation of polioviruses complicates the polio endgame by affecting the confidence with which we can certify successful eradication (i.e., the end of transmission everywhere) given a long enough period of time with active surveillance and no observed detections. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative continues to use three years without observing paralytic cases caused by wild poliovirus (WPV) infection as an indication of sufficient confidence that poliovirus circulation stopped (assuming good surveillance). Prior modeling demonstrated the complexities of real populations and the imperfect nature of real surveillance systems, and highlighted the need for modeling the specific last reservoirs of undetected circulation. We use a poliovirus transmission model developed for Borno and Yobe to characterize the probability of undetected poliovirus circulation once apparent die-out occurs (i.e., in the absence of epidemiological signals) for WPV serotypes 1 and 3. Specifically, we convert the model to a stochastic form that supports estimates of confidence about no circulation given the time since the last detected event and considering the quality of both immunization and surveillance activities for these states. We find high confidence of no WPV3 circulation, and increasing confidence of WPV1 circulation, which we anticipate will imply high confidence in the absence of any detected cases in mid-2020 so long as Borno and Yobe maintain similar or achieve improved conditions. Our results confirm that gaps in poliovirus surveillance or reaching elimination with borderline sufficient population immunity can substantially increase the time to reach a high confidence about no undetected poliovirus transmission.

AB Since most poliovirus infections occur with no paralytic symptoms, the possibility of silent circulation complicates the confirmation of the end of poliovirus transmission. Based on empirical field experience and theoretical modeling results, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative identified three years without observing paralytic cases from wild polioviruses with good acute flaccid paralysis surveillance as an indication of sufficient confidence that poliovirus circulation stopped. The complexities of real populations and the imperfect nature of real surveillance systems subsequently demonstrated the importance of specific modeling for areas at high risk of undetected circulation, resulting in varying periods of time required to obtain the same level of confidence about no undetected circulation. Using a poliovirus transmission model that accounts for variability in transmissibility and neurovirulence for different poliovirus serotypes and characterizes country-specific factors (e.g., vaccination and surveillance activities, demographics) related to wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan, we consider the probability of undetected poliovirus circulation for those countries once apparent die-out occurs (i.e., in the absence of any epidemiological signals). We find that gaps in poliovirus surveillance or reaching elimination with borderline sufficient population immunity could significantly increase the time to reach high confidence about interruption of live poliovirus transmission, such that the path taken to achieve and maintain poliovirus elimination matters. Pakistan and Afghanistan will need to sustain high-quality surveillance for polioviruses after apparent interruption of transmission and recognize that as efforts to identify cases or circulating live polioviruses decrease, the risks of undetected circulation increase and significantly delay the global polio endgame.

ID VACCINATION
AB The obligations of organisations associated with policy formation and implementation of international mass public health programmes are explored. Lines of responsibility are considered to become unclear because of the large number of agencies associated with such programmes. A separation of the relevant obligations among the bodies responsible for the formulation (usually an international non-governmental organisation) and those responsible for the implementation of the policies (usually national bodies) is suggested. The continuing oral polio vaccine campaign against poliomyelitis in India is used to illustrate the general argument. Although the aim of the programme is legitimate and laudable, unnecessary harm is currently being caused to some children as a result of elements of the policy and this should be rectified immediately. Such mass programmes should take care to ensure that people are not unnecessarily sacrificed in the drive to attain the desirable ends of the policy.

AB The success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative promises to bring large benefits, including sustained improvements in quality of life (i.e., cases of paralytic disease and deaths avoided) and costs saved from cessation of vaccination. Obtaining and maintaining these benefits requires that policymakers manage the transition from the current massive use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to a world without OPV and free of the risks of potential future reintroductions of live polioviruses. This article describes the analytical journey that began in 2001 with a retrospective case study on polio risk management and led to development of dynamic integrated risk, economic, and decision analysis tools to inform global policies for managing the risks of polio. This analytical journey has provided several key insights and lessons learned that will be useful to future analysts involved in similar complex decision-making processes.

AB Waning immunity could allow transmission of polioviruses without causing poliomyelitis by promoting silent circulation (SC). Undetected SC when oral polio vaccine (OPV) use is stopped could cause difficult to control epidemics. Little is known about waning. To develop theory about what generates SC, we modeled a range of waning patterns. We varied both OPV and wild polio virus (WPV) transmissibility, the time from beginning vaccination to reaching low polio levels, and the infection to paralysis ratio (IPR). There was longer SC when waning continued over time rather than stopping after a few years, when WPV transmissibility was higher or OPV transmissibility was lower, and when the IPR was higher. These interacted in a way that makes recent emergence of prolonged SC a possibility. As the time to reach low infection levels increased, vaccine rates needed to eliminate polio increased and a threshold was passed where prolonged low-level SC emerged. These phenomena were caused by increased contributions to the force of infection from reinfections. The resulting SC occurs at low levels that would be difficult to detect using environmental surveillance. For all waning patterns, modest levels of vaccination of adults shortened SC. Previous modeling studies may have missed these phenomena because (1) they used models with no or very short duration waning and (2) they fit models to paralytic polio case counts. Our analyses show that polio case counts cannot predict SC because nearly identical polio case count patterns can be generated by a range of waning patterns that generate different patterns of SC. We conclude that the possibility of prolonged SC is real but unquantified, that vaccinating modest fractions of adults could reduce SC risk, and that joint analysis of acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance data can help assess SC risks and ensure low risks before stopping OPV.

TI POLIOMYELITIS IN AN ISOLATED POPULATION - REPORT OF A TYPE-1 EPIDEMIC IN
   THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, 1963
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB During the first 2 months of 1963, an epidemic of paralytic poliomyelitis due to type 1 virus occurred in the Marshall Islands in the Western Pacific. The first paralytic case was 1 of 2 cases occurring in an American population of 3,000 living on Kwajalein Island. The American population, including 700 children, were well immunized with Salk vaccine. The remaining 194 cases were among the 8,740 Marshallese exposed to the virus of which over 80% of the cases occurred in children 6 years of age and under. While the attack rate for the total population was 22.2% the age-specific attack rate in the young age group exceeded 85%. The origin of the virus causing this epidemic is postulated, and the mode of spread to the susceptible Marshallese demonstrated. The exact time of introduction of the epidemic virus into each community could be documented, provoding an opportunity to determine the incubation period. The average period from potential infection to paralysis was 9.4 days with cases occurring as early as 4 days following exposure. Type 1 poliovirus was isolated from the initial paralytic case and from 23 rectal and 15 throat swabs taken from cases on the first atoll involved in the epidemic. The same virus type was also recovered from cases on two of the other affected atolls. Type 1 oral polio vaccine was given to the entire population and was effective in markedly reducing the incidence of paralysis when immunization occurred at or a few days after the introduction of virulent virus. Quarantine measures and oral vaccine were used in preventing the spread of disease beyond the Marshall Islands.

AB The purpose of this study was to report the results of the first two years' surveillance programme of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Southern Italy (Calabria). All paediatric, neurology and infectious diseases wards from 23 hospitals were selected. Stool and serum samples to determine the presence of poliovirus were collected. Throat swabs were takes within 10 days of onset of illness. During the period March 1997 - April 1999 eight cases of AFP were reported and four of them, three females and one male, occurred in children younger than 15 y of age, although none was confirmed as poliomyelitis. The rate of non-polio AFP in 1997 and 1998 was, respectively, 0.24 and 0.73 per 100 000 persons under 15 y of age. Our results demonstrated that an active surveillance has permitted us to immediately detect AFP cases and to exclude those due to wild polio virus and to vaccine-associated cases and indicated that our area seems to be 'polio-free'.

AB In 1875 M Raymond described a progressive muscle wasting and weakness in 3 individuals survivors of childhood acute poliomyelitis. Jean-Martin Charcot suggested that the initial injury should let these guys neurons more sensitive to develop posterior spinal diseases and new weakness was the result of overuse of the affected muscles. In 1979, after the publication of the description given by a 57 year old patient on motor difficulties that developed after suffering of polio in childhood, there was a very significant increase of comments of other individuals with similar symptoms, reaching wedged in the 80s the term of post-polio syndrome. The term is reserved for describing the development of new neurological symptoms, especially for the development of muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and new muscle fatigue not explained by other medical causes, and appear after more than 15 years of infection acute. Is estimated to affect 20 to 85% of individuals with a history of polio in childhood. In 2000 first described the diagnostic criteria. This syndrome determines a change in the functional abilities. Its pathogenesis is unknown, may be associated with aging. It could also be due to an inflammatory persistent or be influenced by genetic factors. There is no effective drug treatment, so I can only recommend symptomatic and moderate muscle training.

TI Would it be legally justified to impose vaccination in Israel? Examining
   the issue in light of the 2013 detection of polio in Israeli sewage
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Polio; Public health law; Autonomy
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH ETHICS; CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; JUSTICE; LAWS
AB Background: The detection of wild poliovirus in Israeli sewage in May 2013 led the health authorities to decide that children who had been vaccinated with IPV would also be vaccinated with OPV. The decision sought to protect vulnerable Israeli individuals who were either not vaccinated with IPV or who suffered from an immune deficiency, to preserve Israel's status as a polio-free country, to prevent the virus' "exportation" into vulnerable polio-free countries, and to participate in the global efforts toward the eradication of polio. After a massive public persuasion campaign, 79% of the children born after 2004 were vaccinated as well as 69% of the children residing in central Israel. A 2014 State Comptroller Report stated that the Ministry of Health should draw conclusions from the low compliance rates in certain Israeli regions.
   Goals: The article seeks to examine the legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination in the service of eradicating a contagious disease (as opposed to preventing a pandemic outbreak), which was one of the objectives in the 2013 Polio case. It more specifically relates to current Israeli law as well as to a hypothetical new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination and enforce this through the use of criminal sanctions.
   Method: Qualitative content analysis through the interpretation of court judgements, laws, legislative protocols, health ministry guidelines and documented discussions of the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization.
   Main findings and conclusion: A mandatory vaccination backed by criminal sanctions in the service of the eradication of contagious diseases would probably be perceived as infringing on the constitutional right to autonomy to a greater extent than necessary according to Israeli law and case law precedents. There may be some added value inherent in a new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination where nonrestrictive measures have been ineffective. However, the law should also specify a variety of sanctions to accompany the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations which would be formulated from least to most restrictive according to the "intervention ladder" concept. The law should also describe the circumstances which would justify the implementation of each and every sanction as well as the procedural safeguards designed for established decisions and fairness toward the individual(s) whose rights are infringed by the application of these sanctions.

ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB Objectives. This study evaluated the impact of international coordination on polio eradication in Southeast Asia.
   Methods. Active surveillance systems for acute flaccid paralysis were assessed. Analyses focused on surveillance proficiency and polio incidence.
   Results. Ten countries coordinated activities. Importations occurred and were rapidly contained in China and Myanmar. Countries that have been free of indigenous polio transmission for at least 3 years include Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand. in the remaining endemic countries-India, Nepal, and Bangladesh-poliovirus transmission has been substantially reduced; however, these countries still harbor the world's largest polio reservoir.
   Conclusions. Unprecedented international coordination in Southeast Asia resulted in dramatic progress in polio eradication and serc es as a paradigm for control of other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.

AB IntroductionRecent reviews summarize evidence that some vaccines have heterologous or non-specific effects (NSE), potentially offering protection against multiple pathogens. Numerous economic evaluations examine vaccines' pathogen-specific effects, but less than a handful focus on NSE. This paper addresses that gap by reporting economic evaluations of the NSE of oral polio vaccine (OPV) against under-five mortality and COVID-19. Materials and methodsWe studied two settings: (1) reducing child mortality in a high-mortality setting (Guinea-Bissau) and (2) preventing COVID-19 in India. In the former, the intervention involves three annual campaigns in which children receive OPV incremental to routine immunization. In the latter, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model was developed to estimate the population benefits of two scenarios, in which OPV would be co-administered alongside COVID-19 vaccines. Incremental cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost ratios were modeled for ranges of intervention effectiveness estimates to supplement the headline numbers and account for heterogeneity and uncertainty. ResultsFor child mortality, headline cost-effectiveness was $650 per child death averted. For COVID-19, assuming OPV had 20% effectiveness, incremental cost per death averted was $23,000-65,000 if it were administered simultaneously with a COVID-19 vaccine <200 days into a wave of the epidemic. If the COVID-19 vaccine availability were delayed, the cost per averted death would decrease to $2600-6100. Estimated benefit-to-cost ratios vary but are consistently high. DiscussionEconomic evaluation suggests the potential of OPV to efficiently reduce child mortality in high mortality environments. Likewise, within a broad range of assumed effect sizes, OPV (or another vaccine with NSE) could play an economically attractive role against COVID-19 in countries facing COVID-19 vaccine delays.

AB Objectives. The United States eliminated indigenous wild polioviruses (WPVs) in 1979 and switched to inactivated poliovirus vaccine in 2000, which quickly ended all indigenous live poliovirus transmission. Continued WPV circulation and use of oral poliovirus vaccine globally allow for the possibility of reintroduction of these viruses. We evaluated the risk of a U.S. polio outbreak and explored potential vaccine needs for outbreak response.
   Methods. We synthesized information available on vaccine coverage, exemptor populations, and population immunity. We used an infection transmission model to explore the potential dynamics of a U.S. polio outbreak and potential vaccine needs for outbreak response, and assessed the impacts of heterogeneity in population immunity for two different subpopulations with potentially low coverage.
   Results. Although the risk of poliovirus introduction remains real, widespread transmission of polioviruses appears unlikely in the U.S., given high routine coverage. However, clusters of un- or underimmunized children might create pockets of susceptibility that could potentially lead to one or more paralytic polio cases. We found that the shift toward combination vaccine utilization, with limited age indications for use, and other current trends (e.g., decreasing proportion of the population with immunity induced by live polioviruses and aging of vaccine exemptor populations) might increase the vulnerability to poliovirus reintroduction at the same time that the ability to respond may decrease.
   Conclusions. The U.S. poliovirus vaccine stockpile remains an important resource that may potentially be needed in the future to respond to an outbreak if a live poliovirus gets imported into a subpopulation with low vaccination coverage.

AB Vaccination rates for mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) and tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and polio (Tdap-IPV) fall short of global targets, highlighting the need for vaccination interventions. This study examines the effectiveness of a city-wide school-based educational vaccination intervention as part of an on-site vaccination program aimed at increasing MMR and Tdap-IPV vaccination rates versus on-site vaccination alone among sociodemographically diverse students from Berlin, Germany. The study was a 1:1 two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, with schools randomly assigned to either the Educational Class Condition (ECC) or the Low-Intensity Information Condition (LIIC). Both received an on-site vaccination program, while students in the ECC received an additional educational unit. Primary outcomes were MMR and Tdap-IPV vaccination rates. In total, 6512 students from 25 randomly selected urban area secondary schools participated. For students providing their vaccination documents on the day of the intervention (2273, 34.9%), adjusted Poisson mixed models revealed significant between-group differences in favor of the ECC (MMR: logRR = 0.47, 95%CI [0.01,0.92], RR = 1.59; Tdap-IPV: logRR = 0.28, 95%CI [0.10,0.47], RR = 1.32). When adjusting for socioeconomic and migration background, between-group differences became non-significant for MMR but remained significant for Tdap-IPV. Findings suggest that educational, school-based on-site vaccination appears to be a promising strategy for increasing vaccination uptake in adolescents.

AB While global polio eradication requires tremendous efforts in countries where wild polioviruses (WPVs) circulate, numerous outbreaks have occurred following WPV importation into previously polio-free countries. Countries that have interrupted endemic WPV transmission should continue to conduct routine risk assessments and implement mitigation activities to maintain their polio-free status as long as wild poliovirus circulates anywhere in the world. This article reviews the methods used by World Health Organization (WHO) regional offices to qualitatively assess risk of WPV outbreaks following an importation. We describe the strengths and weaknesses of various risk assessment approaches, and opportunities to harmonize approaches. These qualitative assessments broadly categorize risk as high, medium, or low using available national information related to susceptibility, the ability to rapidly detect WPV, and other population or program factors that influence transmission, which the regions characterize using polio vaccination coverage, surveillance data, and other indicators (e.g., sanitation), respectively. Data quality and adequacy represent a challenge in all regions. WHO regions differ with respect to the methods, processes, cut-off values, and weighting used, which limits comparisons of risk assessment results among regions. Ongoing evaluation of indicators within regions and further harmonization of methods between regions are needed to effectively plan risk mitigation activities in a setting of finite resources for funding and continued WPV circulation.

TI Certifying the interruption of wild poliovirus transmission in the WHO

DT Article
ID NIGERIA; ERADICATION; CERTIFICATION
AB On Aug 25 2020, the Africa Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication declared that the WHO African region had interrupted transmission of all indigenous wild polioviruses. This declaration marks the African region as the fifth of the six WHO regions to celebrate this extraordinary achievement. Following the Yaounde Declaration on Polio Eradication in Africa by heads of state and governments in 1996, Nelson Mandela launched the Kick Polio out of Africa campaign. In this Health Policy paper, we describe the long and turbulent journey to the certification of the interruption of wild poliovirus transmission, focusing on 2016-20, lessons learned, and the strategies and analyses that convinced the Regional Commission that the African region is free of wild polioviruses. This certification of the WHO African region shows the feasibility of polio eradication in countries with chronic insecurity, inaccessible and hard -to-reach populations, and weak health systems. Challenges have been daunting and the sacrifices enormous-dozens of health workers and volunteers have lost their lives in the pursuit of a polio-free Africa.

AB Eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) types 1 and 3, prevention and cessation of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, and achievement and maintenance of a world free of paralytic polio cases requires active risk management by focusing on population immunity and coordinated cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). We suggest the need for a complementary and different conceptual approach to achieve eradication compared to the current case-based approach using surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to identify symptomatic poliovirus infections. Specifically, we describe a modeling approach to characterize overall population immunity to poliovirus transmission. The approach deals with the realities that exposure to live polioviruses (e.g., WPV, OPV) and/or vaccination with inactivated poliovirus vaccine provides protection from paralytic polio (i.e., disease), but does not eliminate the potential for reinfection or asymptomatic participation in poliovirus transmission, which may increase with time because of waning immunity. The AFP surveillance system provides evidence of symptomatic poliovirus infections detected, which indicate immunity gaps after outbreaks occur, and this system represents an appropriate focus for controlling disease outbreaks. We describe a conceptual dynamic model to characterize population immunity to poliovirus transmission that helps identify risks created by immunity gaps before outbreaks occur, which provides an opportunity for national and global policymakers to manage the risk of poliovirus and prevent outbreaks before they occur. We suggest that dynamically modeling risk represents an essential tool as the number of cases approaches zero.

AB Paralytic poliomyelitis has plagued mankind for centuries. The incidence of acute paralytic poliomyelitis dramatically declined in 1955 only after the introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine. Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) was described as early as the 1870s, but was not clearly recognized by the medical community until the early 1980s. This article reviews the history and epidemiology of acute paralytic poliomyelitis, as well as post-polio syndrome, from its early description by Charcot and others in 1875, to the modern roots of PPS research in 1954. Finally, we will describe the presenting features of PPS, in both clinical and population studies which represent two very different 'faces' of post-polio. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI Understanding vaccine hesitancy in polio eradication in northern Nigeria
SO VACCINE
LA English

DE Polio; Vaccination; Demand; Attitudes; Governance
ID HEALTH
AB Background: Vaccine hesitancy constitutes a major threat to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), and to further expansion of routine immunisation. Understanding hesitancy, leading in some cases to refusal, is vital to the success of GPEI. Re-emergence of circulating wild poliovirus in northern Nigeria in mid-2016, after 24 months polio-free, gives urgency to this. But it is equally important to protect and sustain the global gains available through routine immunisation in a time of rising scepticism and potential rejection of specific vaccines or immunisation more generally.
   Methods and findings: This study is based on a purposive sampling survey of 1653 households in high and low-performing rural, semiurban and urban areas of three high-risk states of northern Nigeria in 2013-14 (Sokoto, Kano and Bauchi). The survey sought to understand factors at household and community level associated with propensity to refuse polio vaccine.
   Wealth, female education and knowledge of vaccines were associated with lower propensity to refuse oral polio vaccine (OPV) among rural households. But higher risk of refusal among wealthier, more literate urban household rendered these findings ambiguous. Ethnic and religious identity did not appear to be associated with risk of OPV refusal.
   Risk of vaccine refusal was highly clustered among households within a small sub-group of sampled settlements. Contrary to expectations, households in these settlements reported higher levels of expectation of government as service provider, but at the same time lesser confidence in the efficacy of their relations with government.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that strategies to address the micro -political dimension of vaccination expanding community-level engagement, strengthening the role of local government in public health, and enhancing public participation of women - should be effective in reducing non-compliance, as an important set of strategies complementary to conventional didactic/educational approaches and working through religious and traditional 'influencers'.

AB Background Eradication of poliovirus from endemic countries relies on vaccination of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) many times a year until the age of 5 years. We aimed to determine caregivers' commitment to OPV in districts of Afghanistan at high risk for polio transmission and to examine what knowledge, attitudes, or experiences could threaten commitment.
   Methods We designed and analysed a poll using face-to-face interviews among caregivers of children under 5 years of age. The sample was drawn via a stratified multistage cluster design with random route household selection. We calculated the percentage of committed and uncommitted caregivers. All percentages were weighted. We then compared percentages of uncommitted caregivers among those with varying knowledge, attitudes, and experiences, using logistic regression to control for possible demographic confounders.
   Findings Between Dec 19, 2014, and Jan 5, 2015, we interviewed 1980 caregivers, 21% of whom were "uncommitted" to accepting OPV. Multiple measures of knowledge, attitudes, and experiences are associated with lack of commitment. For example, compared with their relevant counterparts, caregivers are more likely to be uncommitted if they did not trust vaccinators "a great deal" (54% vs 9%), if they do not know that polio spreads through contaminated water (41% vs 14%), or if they believe rumours that OPV is not halal (50% vs 21%).
   Interpretation To enhance OPV commitment, it might be useful to consider a multifactorial approach that highlights building trust in vaccinators, providing facts about transmission, sharing positive messages to overcome key rumours, and strengthening community support for vaccination.

AB Objectives. We assessed the costs, risks, and benefits of possible future major policy decisions on vaccination, surveillance, response plans, and containment following global eradication of wild polioviruses.
   Methods. We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net benefits of risk management options for polio for the 20-year period and stratified the world according to income level to capture important variability between nations.
   Results. For low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income groups currently using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), we found that after successful eradication of wild polioviruses, OPV cessation would save both costs and lives when compared with continued use of OPV without supplemental immunization activities. We found cost-effectiveness ratios for switching from OPV to inactivated poliovirus vaccine to be higher (i.e., less desirable) than other health investment opportunities, depending on the actual inactivated poliovirus vaccine costs and assumptions about whether supplemental immunization activities with OPV would continue.
   Conclusions. Eradication promises billions of dollars of net benefits, although global health policy leaders face difficult choices about future policies. Until successful eradication and coordination of posteradication policies, health authorities should continue routine polio vaccination and supplemental immunization activities.

AB If the world can successfully control all outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus that may occur soon after global oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation, then immunodeficiencyassociated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) from rare and mostly asymptomatic long-term excretors (defined as >= 6 months of excretion) will become the main source of potential poliovirus outbreaks for as long as iVDPV excretion continues. Using existing models of global iVDPV prevalence and global long-term poliovirus risk management, we explore the implications of uncertainties related to iVDPV risks, including the ability to identify asymptomatic iVDPV excretors to treat with polio antiviral drugs (PAVDs) and the transmissibility of iVDPVs. The expected benefits of expanded screening to identify and treat long-term iVDPV excretors with PAVDs range from US$0.7 to 1.5 billion with the identification of 25-90% of asymptomatic long-term iVDPV excretors, respectively. However, these estimates depend strongly on assumptions about the transmissibility of iVDPVs and model inputs affecting the global iVDPV prevalence. For example, the expected benefits may decrease to as low as US$260 million with the identification of 90% of asymptomatic iVDPV excretors if iVDPVs behave and transmit like partially reverted viruses instead of fully reverted viruses. Comprehensive screening for iVDPVs will reduce uncertainties and maximize the expected benefits of PAVD use.

   detection probability using simulation models

ID POLIOMYELITIS OUTBREAK; CIRCULATION; TYPE-3
AB Efficiency of environmental surveillance of poliovirus circulation was studied using simulation models. First, three transmission models were defined for describing different scenarios of poliovirus infections in a large unstructured population. Second, environmental factors, such as the total volume of the sewage network and losses of viruses, were modeled for computing the virus output at the sewage sampling site. Third, the effect of sampling and laboratory procedures was accounted for in the probability of detection, given the amount of polio-viruses in a specimen. The simulation model can be used for theoretical assessments of the likely efficiency of environmental surveillance, compared with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. Under reasonable assumptions in a vaccinated population, the AFP surveillance can be outperformed if the poliovirus outbreak is not large. However, this depends on the assumed case-to-infection ratio and on the sampling frequency of the sewage water specimens. Increasing the latter will lead to a higher detection probability, which will further enhance the method based on environmental surveillance.

TI A NEW EPIDEMIOLOGIC AND LABORATORY CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM FOR PARALYTIC
   POLIOMYELITIS CASES
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB An epidemiologic classification of paralytic poliomyelitis cases (ECPPC) has been in use in the United States since 1976. In 1985, this classification system was reviewed because of recent changes in the epidemiology of paralytic poliomyelitis and improved laboratory capability to definitively characterize poliovirus strains. An alternative classification system was devised, the epidemiologic and laboratory classification of paralytic polio cases (ELCPPC), that incorporated virus isolation and strain characterization with epidemiologic information. Reported paralytic poliomyelitis cases for 1980-86 were classified by both the ECPPC and the ELCPPC classification systems. The new ELCPPC system classified 91 per cent of the reported cases as vaccine-associated, while the ECPPC system classified only 71 per cent of the reported cases as vaccine-associated. The proposed classification system provides more specific and useful information particularly concerning vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis.

AB Background: A recent WHO review concluded that live BOG and measles vaccine (MV) may have beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs) reducing mortality from non-targeted diseases. NSEs of oral polio vaccine (OPV) were not examined. If OPV vaccination campaigns reduce the mortality rate, it would suggest beneficial NSEs.
   Setting: Between 2002 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau had 15 general OPV campaigns and other campaigns with OPV plus vitamin A supplementation (VAS), VAS-only, MV, and H1N1 vaccine. In this period, we conducted seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality as main outcome.
   Methods: Within these RCTs, we assessed whether the mortality rate was lower after-campaign than before-campaign. We used Cox models with age as underlying time and further adjusted for low birth-weight, season and time trend in mortality. We calculated the adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR) for after-campaign vs before-campaign.
   Results: The mortality rate was lower after OPV-only campaigns than before, the MRR being 0.81 (95% Cl = 0.68-0.95). With each additional dose of campaign-OPV the mortality rate declined further (MRR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.96) per dose) (test for trend, p = 0.005). No other type of campaign had similar beneficial effects. Depending on initial age and with follow-up to 3 years of age, the number needed to treat with campaign-OPV-only to save one life was between 68 and 230 children.
   Conclusion: Bissau had no case of polio infection so the results suggest that campaign-OPV has beneficial NSEs. Discontinuation of OPV-campaigns in low-income countries may affect general child mortality levels negatively.

AB High dropout rates in the uptake of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and DTP vaccine persist despite efforts to improve immunisation coverage. This study identified determinants of uptake of third doses of OPV3 and DTP3 among infants who received first doses of either or both vaccines at immunisation centres in the Ibadan North Local Government Area of Nigeria.
   Using a cohort study design, 400 mother-child pairs were assessed. A semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from each participant who were followed up for 90 days. Dates of subsequent doses of the vaccines were recorded. Multivariate analysis was performed using the log-rank test and Cox's regression analysis to identify predictive factors.
   Only 43.5% (174/400) and 24.8% (89/359) of children completed the OPV3 and DTP3 vaccines, respectively. Factors predictive of uptake of OPV3 were first birth (HR=1.66, 95% CI 1.11-2.48) and attending a tertiary health facility (HR=2.27, 95% CI 1.41-3.65), while attending a secondary health facility was significant for DTP3 uptake (HR=2.43, 95% CI 1.30-4.61).
   Uptake of third doses of vaccines was influenced by the type of health facility attended and the child birth order. Efforts to reduce vaccination dropouts should include creation of awareness of the importance of completing immunisation schedules for children of higher birth orders as well as improved service delivery at health facilities.

AB Nigeria has made remarkable progress against polio, but 2 wild polio virus cases were reported in August 2016; putting an end to 2 y without reported cases. We examined the extent of geographical disparities in childhren not vaccinated against polio and examined individual- and community-level predictors of non-vaccination in Nigeria. We applied multilevel logistic regression models to the recent Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The percentage of children not routinely vaccinated against polio in Nigeria varied greatly and clustered geographically, mainly in north-eastern states, with a great risk of spread of transmission within these states and potential exportation to neighboring states and countries. Only about one-third had received all recommended 4 routine oral polio vaccine doses. Non-vaccinated children tended to have a mother who had no formal education and who was currently not working, live in poorer households and were from neighborhoods with higher maternal illiteracy rates.

AB Polio can circulate unobserved in regions that are challenging to monitor. To assess the probability of silent circulation, simulation models can be used to understand transmission dynamics when detection is unreliable. Model assumptions, however, impact the estimated probability of silent circulation. Here, we examine the impact of having distinct populations, rather than a single well-mixed population, with a discrete-individual model including environmental surveillance. We show that partitioning a well-mixed population into networks of distinct communities may result in a higher probability of silent circulation as a result of the time it takes for the detection of a circulation event. Population structure should be considered when assessing polio control in a region with many loosely interacting communities.

AB Many of medical anthropology's most pressing research questions require an understanding how infections, money, and ideas move around the globe. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a $9 billion project that has delivered 20 billion doses of oral polio vaccine in campaigns across the world. With its array of global activities, it cannot be comprehensively explored by the traditional anthropological method of research at one field site.
   This article describes an ethnographic study of the GPEI, a collaborative effort between researchers at eight sites in seven countries. We developed a methodology grounded in nuanced understandings of local context but structured to allow analysis of global trends. Here, we examine polio vaccine acceptance and refusal to understand how global phenomena-in this case, policy decisions by donors and global health organizations to support vaccination campaigns rather than building health systems-shape local behavior.

AB The possibility of periodic routine vaccination campaigns (PRVCs) is introduced in the context of a search for optimal oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) administration strategies. Like the usual continuous routine vaccination campaign (CRVC), PRVCs target only newborns. However, they are not necessarily implemented continuously in time. Using a dynamic and compartmental polio transmission model in a stochastic context, it is shown that some PRVCs can achieve much greater efficiency than CRVC in terms of probability of wild poliovirus (WPV) eradication, even though they never outperform CRVC in terms of total number of paralytic infections. Moreover, these PRVCs results can be obtained at a lower price than CRVC. It is also shown that, even though PRVCs do not perform better than pulse vaccination campaigns (PVCs) when only epidemiological outputs are valued, they can do so when a cost-benefit analysis is preferred.

LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS; ENTEROVIRUSES
AB Background: China has been polio-free since 2000 and maintains an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance system. Residual paralysis (RP) in children with acute flaccid paralysis can be caused by Sabinstrain poliovirus (PV) and non-polio enteroviruses (NPEV).
   Methods: The national AFP surveillance data was analyzed to describe AFP cases with RP in the mainland of China during 2001 to 2010. Epidemiological patterns and virus detection of AFP cases with RP were described.
   Results: Annual incidence of AFP with RP among children aged <15 years old ranged between 0.22-0.35 cases per 100,000. The peak age for AFP with RP and PV was 2 to 4 months. Among cases with viral Sabinstrain viral isolates, types II and III were the most common. A summer season peak in RP cases was similar to cases with NPEV isolated.
   Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: The first ten years after polio eradication of AFP surveillance data for the occurrence of RP can serve as a baseline rate for poliovirus vaccine changes in the routine immunization system to help detect vaccine safety signals in a timely manner and to support the routine polio immunization program switch in China.

AB Background. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Strategic Plan for 2019-2023 includes commitments to monitor the quality of immunization campaigns using lot quality assurance sampling surveys (LQAS) and to support poliovirus surveillance in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   Methods. We analyzed LQAS and poliovirus surveillance data between 2016 and 2020, which included both acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case-based detection and the continued expansion of environmental surveillance (ES). Using updated estimates for unit costs, we explore the costs of different options for future poliovirus monitoring and surveillance for Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   Results. The relative value of the information provided by campaign quality monitoring and surveillance remains uncertain and depends on the design, implementation, and performance of the systems. Prospective immunization campaign quality monitoring (through LQAS) and poliovirus surveillance will require tens of millions of dollars each year for the foreseeable future for Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   Conclusions. LQAS campaign monitoring as currently implemented in Pakistan and Afghanistan provides limited and potentially misleading information about immunization quality. AFP surveillance in Pakistan and Afghanistan provides the most reliable evidence of transmission, whereas ES provides valuable supplementary information about the extent of transmission in the catchment areas represented at the time of sample collection.

TI INFLUENCE OF VACCINATION WITH FORMALIN INACTIVATED VACCINE UPON
   GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTION WITH POLIOVIRUSES
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of vaccination with killed poliomyelitis vaccine upon the susceptibility of the gastrointestinal tract to polio-viruses was investigated. Family contacts of known cases of polio-myelitis were studied. Children vaccinated with one or 2 doses were found to be excreting virus as frequently in their feces as were their unvaccinated peers. Only 8 children who had received 3 properly spaced injections of vaccine were available for study and poliovirus was isolated from 3. In order to determine whether or not vaccination had been effective in evoking neutralizing antibody, tests were run on the sera of many of the family contacts of poliomyelitis patients. Additional data of the same type were accumulated from persons in families in which there was no polivirus infection. Comparisons in regard to the presence or absence of antibody and the titer of antibody revealed little differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated children. What differences were observed indicated that the type 2 component of the vaccine was a better antigen than types 1 and 3. Data are presented which suggest that neutralizing antibody in the blood has little influence upon the susceptibility of the lower intestinal tract of man to poliovirus infection. However, the age of the individual, unrelated to the presence of antibody, correlates well with the presence of virus in the feces. The younger the person, the more likely is he to be infected. Evidence is also presented, in confirmation of that of others, indicating that even in persons known to be infected with poliovirus, the virus is more frequently isolated from children than from adults. It is concluded that immunization with killed poliomyelitis vaccines cannot be expected to decrease the numbers of persons in the community with alimentary poliovirus infection. Thus, vaccination, while of value to the persons immunized, is unlikely to provide pro-tection to those not vaccinated.

TI Threats to polio eradication in high-conflict areas in Pakistan and
   Nigeria: a polling study of caregivers of children younger than 5 years
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article

AB Background Elimination of poliovirus from endemic countries is a crucial step in eradication; however, vaccination programmes in these areas face challenges, especially in regions with conflict. We analysed interviews with caregivers of children living in two polio-endemic countries to assess whether these challenges are largely operational or also driven by resistance or misinformation in the community.
   Methods We designed and analysed polls based on face-to-face interviews of a random sample of parents and other caregivers of children younger than 5 years in regions of Pakistan and Nigeria at high risk for polio transmission. In both countries, the sample was drawn via a stratified multistage duster design with random route household selection. The questionnaire covered awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about polio and oral polio vaccine (OPV), trust in vaccination efforts, and caregiver priorities for government action. We assessed experiences of caregivers in accessible higher-conflict areas and compared their knowledge and attitudes with those in lower-conflict areas. Differences were tested with two-sample t tests.
   Findings The poll consisted of 3396 caregivers from Pakistan and 2629 from Nigeria. About a third of caregivers who responded in higher-conflict areas of Pakistan (Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA], 30%) and Nigeria (Borno, 33%) were unable to confirm that their child was vaccinated in the previous campaign. In FATA, 12% of caregivers reported that they were unaware of polio, and in Borno 12% of caregivers reported that vaccinators visited but their child did not receive the vaccine or they did not know whether the child was vaccinated. Additionally, caregivers in higher-conflict areas are less likely to hold beliefs about OPV that could motivate acceptance and are more likely to hold concerns than are caregivers in lower-conflict areas.
   Interpretation Beyond the difficulties in reaching homes with OPV, challenges for vaccination programmes in higher-conflict areas extend to limited awareness, negative attitudes, and gaps in trust. Vaccination efforts might need to address underlying attitudes of caregivers through direct communications and the selection and training of local vaccinators.

AB Death of motor neurones following invasion of the central nervous system by poliovirus may result in paralysis of specific muscles.  Virulence may be tested by injection into monkeys by routes which bypass natural infection.  Transmissibility is also very important, but cannot be measured, only inferred.  An infection may lead to immunity or paralysis.  In epidemics, the highest incidence among children 0-2 years was 2% and among those over 10 years was 25%:  these figures fit a model of genetic susceptibility of homozygotes and heterozygotes with phenotypic susceptibility increasing with age.  Hypogamma-globulinemics, some neonates and pregnant women are more susceptible than others.  Intra-muscular injections may increase the risk of paralysis.  Strenuous exercise and IM injections given when poliovirus has already reached the spinal cord can increase the severity of paralysis or convert a non-paralytic attack to paralysis.
   Although vaccines reduced polio in temperate countries, polio was thought to be no problem in the tropics.  Since 1977 polio has been recognised as a massive problem in the third world:  because it affects babies and very young children, it is properly infantile paralysis.

AB Achieving global polio eradication requires that global stakeholders coordinate and cooperate to invest human and financial resources in interventions that prevent virus transmission. Reaching this goal depends on effective tools and interventions, and their optimal use. Poliovirus transmission occurs in a complex global system with rapidly evolving viruses that readily cross international borders. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of four spearheading partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), initiated a collaboration with Kid Risk, Inc. to develop and apply integrated analytical models to answer high-stakes policy questions related to managing the risks of polioviruses with consideration of human health and economic outcomes. Over the last decade, the collaboration innovatively combined numerous operations research and management science tools, including simulation, decision and risk analysis, system dynamics, and optimization to help policy makers understand and quantify the implications of their choices. These integrated modeling efforts helped motivate faster responses to polio outbreaks, leading to a global resolution and significantly reduced response time and outbreak sizes. Insights from the models also underpinned a 192-country resolution to coordinate global cessation of the use of one of the two vaccines after wild poliovirus eradication (i.e., allowing continued use of the other vaccine as desired). Finally, the model results helped us to make the economic case for a continued commitment to polio eradication by quantifying the value of prevention and showing the health and economic outcomes associated with the alternatives. The work helped to raise the billions of dollars needed to support polio eradication. The investments will prevent devastating cases of polio and realize an estimated $40-$50 billion in net benefits by the countries covered by the GPEI, while protecting the significantly larger net benefits enjoyed by the countries that stopped wild poliovirus transmission without support of the GPEI.

TI Routine immunization in Pakistan: comparison of multiple data sources
   and identification of factors associated with vaccination
SO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH

AB Background: Within Pakistan, estimates of vaccination coverage with the pentavalent vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and measles vaccine (MV) in 2011 were reported to be 74%, 75% and 53%, respectively. These national estimates may mask regional variation. The reasons for this variation have not been explored.
   Methods: Data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) for Balochistan and Punjab (2010-2011) are analysed to examine factors associated with receiving three or more doses of the pentavalent vaccine and one or more MVs using regression modelling. Pentavalent and OPV estimates from the MICS were compared to vaccine dose histories from surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP; poliomyelitis) to ascertain agreement.
   Results: Adjusted coverage of children 12-23 months of age were estimated to be 16.0%, 75.5% and 34.2% in Balochistan and 58.0%, 87.7% and 72.6% in Punjab for the pentavalent vaccine, OPV and MV, respectively. Maternal education, healthcare utilization and wealth were associated with receiving the pentavalent vaccine and the MV. There was a strong correlation of district estimates of vaccination coverage between AFP and MICS data, but AFP estimates of pentavalent coverage in Punjab were biased toward higher values.
   Conclusions: National estimates mask variation and estimates from individual surveys should be considered alongside other estimates. The development of strategies targeted towards poorly educated parents within low-wealth quintiles that may not typically access healthcare could improve vaccination rates.

AB ObjectivesThe traditional polio model depicts a positive relationship between the disease and socioeconomic status (SES), with higher SES associated with exposure to the poliovirus beyond infancy/early childhood and a higher mortality rate. This study uses occupation data from non-Maori New Zealand death registrations and the Census to assess evidence for differential mortality by SES during the polio epidemics of 1916, 1924-25, and 1936-37. Materials and MethodsPolio deaths were classified by father's occupation using the Caversham Project scheme, which includes nine collapsible urban occupational strata and codes rural occupations separately. Evidence for differential mortality and differences in age at death between rural and urban areas and among urban occupational strata was assessed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Jonckheere-Terpstra, and chi-square tests. ResultsThere was limited evidence of either differential mortality or differences in age at death among collapsed urban strata, mainly in 1924/25, only partially meeting the expectations of the traditional polio model. For 1916 only, the rural group had a higher proportion of deaths (chi(2) (1, n = 95) = 8.341, p = 0.0039, phi = 0.30)) and higher age at death (U = 828.00, p = 0.026, r = -0.23). DiscussionThese results suggest that rural New Zealand was more isolated from poliovirus infection prior to 1916, but thereafter rural and urban groups faced more similar exposure patterns and mortality-at least among non-Maori. The degree to which occupational categories reflect conditions of exposure requires further research.

TI Violence, insecurity, and the risk of polio: A systematic analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Background
   Since the introduction of polio vaccines in the 1950's and 60's, eradication of poliovirus from the world has been technically feasible. Progress towards this goal, however, has been uneven and influenced by social and political factors that challenge the implementation of robust immunization programs. While violence and insecurity are often cited as barriers to eradication, current global risk models are largely based on virologic and immunologic indicators measured at national levels. In this manuscript, we quantify the relevance of indicators of violence and insecurity on the risk of polio spread.
   Methods and findings
   Using logistic regression models and public data sources, we evaluate the relationship between measures of violence and instability and the location of poliomyelitis cases between 2006 and 2015 at the country-level, both individually and after controlling for more proximal determinants of disease, such as nearby circulating poliovirus and vaccination rates. We found that increases in a country's Fragile States Index (FSI) and Global Peace Index (GPI), aggregate indicators of violence and instability, were associated with the occurrence of poliovirus cases in the subsequent year (p<0.01), even after controlling for established risk factors. These effects of violence and insecurity must be mediated through immunity and exposure to poliovirus, coarse measures of which are included in our model. This also implies that in our study, and in risk models in general, the interpretation depends on the quality and granularity of available data.
   Conclusion
   National virologic and immunologic indicators understate the risk of poliovirus spread in areas with violence and insecurity, and the inclusion of such factors improves precision. In addition, the link between violence and incidence of disease highlights the broader challenge of implementing health interventions in conflict areas. We discuss practical implications of this work in understanding and measuring the risks to polio eradication and other global health initiatives, and the policy implications of the need to reach vulnerable populations in conflict zones.

AB Objectives: As efforts to control COVID-19 continue, we simulate hypothetical emergence of wild poliovirus assuming an immunologically naive population. This differs from the current global experience with polio and serves as a model for responding to future pandemics.
   Methods: Applying an established global model, we assume a fully susceptible global population to polioviruses, independently introduce a virus with properties of each of the three stable wild poliovirus serotypes, and explore the impact of strategies that range from doing nothing to seeking global containment and eradication.
   Results: We show the dynamics of paralytic cases as the virus spreads globally. We demonstrate the difficulty of eradication unless aggressive efforts begin soon after initial disease detection. Different poliovirus serotypes lead to different trajectories and burdens of disease. In the absence of aggressive measures, the virus would become globally endemic in 2-10 years, and cumulative paralytic cases would exceed 4-40 million depending on serotype, with the burden of disease shifting to younger ages.
   Conclusions: The opportunity to eradicate emerging infections represents an important public policy choice. If the world first observed the emergence of wild poliovirus in 2020, adopting aggressive control strategies would have been required to prevent a devastating global pandemic.

TI Eradication of Poliomyelitis in Iran, a Historical Perspective
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Poliomyelitis; Eradication; Immunization; Iran
AB Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades the nervous system, and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. After initiation of polio eradication programme in 1988 by WHO, number of polio cases abruptly decreased. In 1988, polio paralyzed nearly 350000 children annually worldwide while in 2007 just 1360 cases reported. The programme has been started in Iran since 1991 and based on high routine immunization coverage, robust Acute Flaccid Paralysis surveillance system and very qualified supplementary immunization activities which has been established and implemented in all the country, number of reported cases decreased from 50 to zero in 2001 and Iran has been polio free since 2001. However due to endemicity of poliomyelitis in Afghanistan and Pakistan (two neighboring countries of Iran) and high level of international traveling between these countries, risk of polio importation and re-emergence of wild polio virus is very high.

AB Background. The first steps (phase 1) toward laboratory containment of poliovirus after eradication are a national survey of biomedical facilities and a global inventory of such facilities retaining wild poliovirus (WPV) infectious and potentially infectious materials.
   Methods.aEuro integral We reviewed published reports on national laboratory surveys and inventories of WPV materials from each of the 3 polio-free World Health Organization (WHO) regions (the European Region, completed in 2006; the Western Pacific Region, completed in 2008; and the Region of the Americas, completed in 2010), as well as reports on progress in polio-free countries of the remaining 3 regions (the African Region, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the WHO South-East Asia Region).
   Results.aEuro integral Containment phase 1 activities are complete in 154 of 194 WHO Member States (79%), including all countries and areas of the polio-free regions and most polio-free countries in the remaining 3 regions. A reported 227 209 biomedical facilities were surveyed, with 532 facilities in 45 countries identified as retaining WPV-associated infectious or potentially infectious materials.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral Completion of containment phase 1 global activities is achievable within the time frame set by the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018.

AB Background: Whole-cell diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) were introduced to children in Guinea-Bissau in 1981. We previously reported that DTP in the target age group from 3 to 5 months of age was associated with higher overall mortality. DTP and OPV were also given to older children and in this study we tested the effect on mortality in children aged 6-35 months.
   Methods: In the 1980s, the suburb Bandim in the capital of Guinea-Bissau was followed with demographic surveillance and tri-monthly weighing sessions for children under 3 years of age. From June 1981, routine vaccinations were offered at the weighing sessions. We calculated mortality hazard ratio (HR) for DTP-vaccinated and DTP-unvaccinated children aged 6-35 months using Cox proportional hazard models. Including this study, the introduction of DTP vaccine and child mortality has been studied in three studies; we made a meta-estimate of these studies.
   Results: At the first weighing session after the introduction of vaccines, 6-35-monthold children who received DTP vaccination had better weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) than children who did not receive DTP; one unit increase in WAZ was associated with an odds ratio of 1.32 (95% CI = 1.13-1.55) for receiving DTP vaccination. Though lower mortality compared with not being DTP-vaccinated was, therefore, expected, DTP vaccination was associated with a non-significant trend in the opposite direction, the HR being 2.22 (0.82-6.04) adjusted for WAZ. In a sensitivity analysis, including all children weighed at least once before the vaccination program started, DTP (+/- OPV) as the most recent vaccination compared with live vaccines or no vaccine was associated with a HR of 1.89 (1.00-3.55). In the three studies of the introduction of DTP in rural and urban Guinea-Bissau, DTP-vaccinated children had an HR of 2.14 (1.42-3.23) compared to DTP-unvaccinated children; this effect was separately significant for girls [HR = 2.60 (1.57-4.32)], but not for boys [HR = 1.71 (0.99-2.93)] (test for interaction p = 0.27).
   Conclusion: Although having better nutritional status and being protected against three infections, 635 months old DTP-vaccinated children tended to have higher mortality than DTP-unvaccinated children. All studies of the introduction of DTP have found increased overall mortality.

ID POLIO ERADICATION; SMALLPOX; LESSONS; AMERICA
AB The fight to achieve global eradication of poliomyelitis continues. Although native transmission of poliovirus was halted in the Western Hemisphere by the early 1990s, and only a few cases have been imported in the past few years, much of Latin America's story remains to be told. Peru conducted a successful flexible, or flattened, vertical campaign in 1991. The initial disease-oriented programs began to collaborate with community-oriented primary health care systems, thus strengthening public-private partnerships and enabling the common goal of poliomyelitis eradication to prevail despite rampant terrorism, economic instability, and political turmoil. Committed leaders in Peru's Ministry of Health, the Pan American Health Organization, and Rotary International, as well as dedicated health workers who acted with missionary zeal, facilitated acquisition of adequate technologies, coordinated work at the local level, and increased community engagement, despite sometimes being unable to institutionalize public health improvements.

TI Estimation of the Direct Cost of Poliomyelitis Rehabilitation Treatment

DT Article
ID POLIO VACCINATION; HEALTH
AB BackgroundPakistan is one of the last few countries in which poliomyelitis is endemic. Evidence indicates that out-of-pocket expenditures are a barrier to polio rehabilitation treatment, yet there are no reported figures related to the financial burden of this disease on patients in a recently polio-endemic country.ObjectiveThis study investigated direct costs attributed to rehabilitation treatment of poliomyelitis among Pakistani patients and reported its duration along with the socioeconomic status of poliomyelitis survivors.ConclusionThe cost of poliomyelitis rehabilitation in Pakistan is high; it has an economic effect on the lives of patients and their families. Despite good education, polio survivors in Pakistan appear to have low socioeconomic status, lower chances of employment and marriage, as well as fewer children. Further research is recommended to explore the burden of disease on society, i.e., indirect costs and suffering.

AB Background: Global polio eradication is a goal yet to be achieved in countries like Pakistan. In recent years, the Polio Eradication Initiative has been making steady progress with good campaign coverage and low numbers of polio cases. However, in 2019 Pakistan reported 146 cases compared to 12 in 2018. A major factor cited for this regression was a surge in vaccine refusals by parents and caretakers. Aims: To assess the reasons for the refusal of polio vaccination in Quetta Block, Balochistan. Methods: The study was conducted using data acquired from 2 polio vaccination campaigns over 3 months in 2019. The data were collected in Quetta Block, a highly endemic zone having continuous transmission of the polio virus over several years. The data were analysed using the statistical software, SPSS, version 20. We used descriptive statistics to demon- strate the characteristics of the study population. Categorical variables were measured as frequencies and percent ages. Results: Refusal rates were almost 8.6% for the polio campaign of April and 8.1% for June 2019. Misconceptions about vaccines made up 56.4% of reasons for refusals, followed by religion 16%. Conclusion: Misconceptions about the vaccine are the main driving force behind vaccine refusals in the study setting. Efficient strategies are required to address misconceptions in this red zone of poliovirus transmission in Balochistan.

AB Nearly 20 years after the year 2000 target for global wild poliovirus (WPV) eradication, live polioviruses continue to circulate with all three serotypes posing challenges for the polio endgame. We updated a global differential equation-based poliovirus transmission and stochastic risk model to include programmatic and epidemiological experience through January 2020. We used the model to explore the likely dynamics of poliovirus transmission for 2019-2023, which coincides with a new Global Polio Eradication Initiative Strategic Plan. The model stratifies the global population into 72 blocks, each containing 10 subpopulations of approximately 10.7 million people. Exported viruses go into subpopulations within the same block and within groups of blocks that represent large preferentially mixing geographical areas (e.g., continents). We assign representative World Bank income levels to the blocks along with polio immunization and transmission assumptions, which capture some of the heterogeneity across countries while still focusing on global poliovirus transmission dynamics. We also updated estimates of reintroduction risks using available evidence. The updated model characterizes transmission dynamics and resulting polio cases consistent with the evidence through 2019. Based on recent epidemiological experience and prospective immunization assumptions for the 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, the updated model does not show successful eradication of serotype 1 WPV by 2023 or successful cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine serotype 2-related viruses.

AB Objectives: To explore the association of maternal education and empowerment with childhood polio vaccination using nationally representative data of Pakistani mothers in a reproductive age group.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Secondary analysis of Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS), 2012-2013 data was performed.
   Participants: Of the 13 558 mothers included in the survey sample, 6982 mothers were able to provide information regarding polio vaccinations.
   Main outcome measures: Polio vaccination coverage among children aged up to 5 years was categorised as complete vaccination (all four oral polio vaccine (OPV) doses), incomplete vaccination, and no vaccination (zero OPV dose received). Mothers' empowerment status was assessed using standard 'Measure DHS' questions regarding their involvement in decision-making related to health, household possessions and visits among family and friends. Education was categorised as no education, primary, secondary and higher education. Results of multinomial regression analyses were reported as adjusted OR with 95% CI. We adjusted for age, wealth index, urban/rural residence, place of delivery, and antenatal and postnatal visits.
   Results: Only 56.4% (n=3936) of the children received complete polio vaccination. Women with no education had significantly higher odds of their child receiving no polio vaccination (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.18; p<0.01) and incomplete vaccination (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.87; p<0.01). Further, unempowered women also had significantly higher odds of not taking their child for any polio vaccination (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.12; p<0.01) and incomplete vaccination (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; p=0.04).
   Conclusions: Illiteracy, socioeconomic status and empowerment of women remained significant factors

AB The last case of polio from India was reported in 2011. That year, the non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) rate in India was 13.35/100,000, where the expected rate is 1-2/100,000. A previous study of data from 2000 to 2010 has detailed the NPAFP rate in a state correlated with the pulse polio rounds conducted there, and the strongest correlation with the NPAFP rate was found when the number of doses from the previous 4 years were used. However, a simple association being found with regression analysis does not prove a causal relationship. After publication of those findings, as the threat of polio had lessened, the number of rounds of OPV administration was brought down. The present study has been done to look at data till the end of 2017, to see if the incidence of NPAFP declined with this reduction in polio immunization rounds. We used polio surveillance data acquired by the Government of India from 2000-2017. Correlation of the NAFP rate to the number of polio rounds in the state was examined, and the cumulative effect of polio doses administered in previous years was sought. NPAFP rate correlated with the OPV pulse polio rounds in that year (R = 0.46; p < 0.001), and the NPAFP rate started to decrease from 2012 when the number of pulse polio rounds had decreased. NPAFP rates in the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar were the highest in the country. Looking at the high-NPAFP states of UP and Bihar, we found that the correlation coefficient was strongest when doses used over 5 years was considered (R = 0.76; p < 0.001). The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. Now that India has been polio-free for over 6 years, we propose that we may be able to reduce NPAFP by further reducing pulse polio rounds.

AB Background: Outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) pose a threat to the eventual eradication of all polioviruses. In 2017, an outbreak of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) occurred in the midst of a war in Syria. We describe vaccination-based risk factors for and the successful response to the outbreak.
   Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis of cVDPV2 cases and key indicators of poliovirus surveil-lance and vaccination activities during 2016-2018. In the absence of reliable subnational coverage data, we used the caregiver-reported vaccination status of children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) as a proxy for vaccination coverage. We then estimated the relative odds of being unvaccinated against polio, comparing children in areas affected by the outbreak to children in other parts of Syria in order to establish the presence of poliovirus immunity gaps in outbreak affected areas.
   Findings: A total of 74 cVDPV2 cases were reported, with paralysis onset ranging from 3 March to 21 September 2017. All but three cases were reported from Deir-ez-Zor governorate and 84% had received < 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). After adjusting for age and sex, non-polio AFP case-patients aged 6-59 months in outbreak-affected areas had 2.5 (95% CI: 1.1-5.7) increased odds of being unvaccinated with OPV compared with non-polio AFP case-patients in the same age group in other parts of Syria. Three outbreak response rounds of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) vaccination were con-ducted, with governorate-level coverage mostly exceeding 80%.
   Interpretation: Significant declines in both national and subnational polio vaccination coverage, precipi-tated by war and a humanitarian crisis, led to a cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria that was successfully contained following three rounds of mOPV2 vaccination. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To measure immunity to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 in the Australian population.
   Methods: Sera were collected opportunistically from laboratories around Australia between 1996 and 1999. A representative sample by age and gender was tested for neutralising antibodies to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3. A titre of greater than or equal to8 was considered antibody positive and indicative of immunity.
   Results: Of the 1,813 sera tested, 82% were antibody positive for poliovirus type 1 and 88% were positive for type 2. Immunity to type 3 poliovirus was lower overall (74%) and especially in school-aged children and young adults. For all three poliovirus types, there were more females immune than males and immunity peaked in the 2-4 years age group. The proportion of the population immune to all three types was 59%, and 3% were negative for all three types.
   Conclusions and Implications: This is the first national serosurvey for immunity to poliovirus in Australia. Herd immunity is probably sufficient to prevent generalised outbreaks due to type 1 and 2 poliovirus, but this may not be the case for type 3. However, localised outbreaks of any poliovirus type could still occur following reintroduction unless uniformly high levels of vaccination coverage are maintained. Ongoing serosurveillance is required following the recent change back to inactivated polio vaccine.

AB Objective: To compare the psychological health of the individuals with long-standing poliomyelitis, with or without post-polio syndrome (PPS), to the general population and to identify the role of work as well as other variables with regard to their psychological health. Design: A cross-sectional study. Subjects: One hundred and ninety-five polio patients attending postpolio clinic in Jerusalem. Methods: Emotional distress (ED) was measured using the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Demographic, medical, social and functional data were recorded using a specific structured questionnaire. Each polio patient was compared to four age- and sex-matched controls. Results: ED was higher in the polio population as compared to the general population. Within the polio population ED was inversely correlated with work status. No correlation was found between ED and the functional level of polio participants and no difference was found in GHQ score between polio participants with or without post-polio. In addition, ED was less affected by subjective perception of physical health among polio patients as compared to the general population. Conclusions: Long-standing poliomyelitis is associated with decreased psychological health as compared to the general population. Yet, the resilience of polio survivors is manifested by their ability to block further decline of their psychological health in spite of deterioration in their physical health. Work appears as a significant source of resilience in the polio population.Implications for RehabilitationIndividuals with long-standing poliomyelitis often suffer from high emotional distress and may benefit from psychotherapy aimed at reducing distress.As active employment status is associated with increased mental health among polio survivors, encouraging participation at work needs to be a significant component of psychotherapeutic programs.Polio survivors, although physically disabled, may be relatively resilient, as their mental health is less affected by their negative health perception. This and other expressions of resilience may serve as a platform for increasing personal growth among them by implementing hope-oriented psychotherapy.

AB This introduction for the third special issue on modeling poliovirus risks provides context for the current status of global polio eradication efforts and gives an overview of the individual papers included in the issue. Although risk analysis continues to support the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), efforts to finish the job remained off track at the beginning of 2020 and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in the special issue. The disruptions associated with COVID-19 occurring now will inevitably change the polio eradication trajectory, and future studies will need to characterize the impacts of these disruptions on the polio endgame.

AB Purpose: Post-polio syndrome refers to a late complication of the poliovirus infection. Management of post-polio syndrome is complex due to the extensive symptomology. European and United Kingdom guidelines have advised the use of rehabilitation programmes to manage post-polio syndrome. There is a paucity of research in relation to the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions. The objective of this study is to explore polio survivor's perceptions of an in-patient multi-disciplinary rehabilitation programme. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of community dwelling polio survivors who attended in-patient rehabilitation programme in the United Kingdom. Thematic analysis was used to describe and interpret interview data. Results: Participants' experiences were influenced by past experiences of polio and their self-concept. Participants generally had a positive experience and valued being with other polio survivors. Positive strategies, such as pacing and reflection changed their mind-sets into their lives after the programme, though they still faced challenges in daily living. Some participants supported others with post-polio syndrome after completing the programme. Conclusions: Our research identified that participants experienced long term positive benefits from attending a rehabilitation programme. Strategies that users found helpful that explored the effectiveness of interventions to manage polio are not cited within a Cochrane review. If we are to recognise the lived experience and service user empowerment within a model of co- production it is essential that patient preferences are evaluated and used as evidence to justify service provision. Further research is required with polio survivors to explore how best rehabilitation programmes can adopt the principles of co-production.

AB Background In June 2018, a type 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV1) outbreak was declared in Papua New Guinea (PNG), resulting in a total of 26 paralytic confirmed cases. Eight vaccination campaign rounds with bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) were carried out in response. Prevalence of neutralizing polio antibodies in children was assessed two years after the outbreak response was completed.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey among children aged 6 months-10 years selected from six provinces in PNG to evaluate seroprevalence of neutralizing polio antibodies to the three poliovirus serotypes and analyse sociodemographic risk factors.Findings We included 984 of 1006 enrolled children in the final analysis. The seroprevalence of neutralizing polio antibodies for serotype 1, 2 and 3 was 98.3% (95% CI: 97.4-98.9), 63.1% (95% CI: 60.1-66.1) and 95.0% (95% CI: 93.6-96.3), respectively. Children <1 year had significantly lower type 1 seroprevalence compared to older children (p < 0.001); there were no significant differences in seroprevalence among provinces.Interpretation PNG successfully interrupted transmission of cVDPV1 with several high coverage bOPV campaigns and seroprevalence remained high after two years. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine immunization coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.

ID VACCINE-DERIVED POLIOVIRUS; SEWAGE; SYSTEM
AB Background: Enteroviruses can easily circulate in the population through sewage and they are suitable indicators for environmental surveillance. On the other hand, in some countries there are evidences of silent circulation of viruses in sewage specimens despite no virus isolation from clinical specimens. Therefore, WHO has suggested environmental surveillance using surface water and sewage specimens for final confirmation of Poliovirus eradication. In this research, according to wild Poliovirus circulation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and probability of virus entrance to Iran, and also to assure wild Poliovirus eradication, the environmental surveillance was performed in Sistan and Balouchestan Province of Iran.
   Methods: From March 2004 to February 2005, 86 specimens from 2 sewage disposal systems, 5 hospitals and surface water from several villages were collected by Grab Sample method and tested for Enteroviruses directly and using 2 concentration methods: Pellet and Two-phase. Then Poliovirus and Non-Polio Enteroviruses (NPEV) were serotyped by microneutralization method and Polioviruses were intratypically differentiated using ELISA and Probe Hybridization techniques.
   Results: From a total of 86 specimens, Enteroviruses and Non-Polio Enteroviruses were isolated from 49(56.98%) and 46(53.49%) of specimens respectively. Polioviruses were isolated from 18(20.93%) specimens and none of them was wild Poliovirus fortunately. 13(17.81%), 39(53.42%) and 57(78.08%) of enteroviruses were isolated using Direct, Pellet and Two-phase methods, respectively.
   Conclusions: The results of this research confirm the validity of environmental surveillance and Polio eradication in Sistan and Balouchestan Province.

AB Objectives: Although the antipolio drive is undertaken across Pakistan, there are still children who have not received any oral polio vaccine or are unable to complete recommended doses of polio vaccine. This study aims at empirically analyzing the associated factors with the no oral polio vaccination (OPV) and OPV dropout groups of children in Pakistan.
   Study design: This is a cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the three waves of Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey of children aged between 12 and 23 months (1990-1991: n = 1214; 2006-2007: n = 1522; 2012-2013: n = 2074). Children who received no OPV and those who drop out of polio vaccination (OPV1-OPV3) were considered as outcome variables. The bivariate relationship of outcome variable with each socio-economic, demographic, and spatial variable is estimated with a P-value of <0.01. For both no OPV and OPV dropout children, we used logistic regression analysis separately.
   Results: The percentage of children aged 12-23 months who dropped out of OPV1-OPV3 vaccination was about 76% in the year 1990-1991; 21% in 2006-2007, and 17.5% in 2012-2013 at the national level. Among all indicators, provinces, rural versus urban residence, themother's age at marriage, the child's birth place (home versus hospital), parental education, and house-hold wealth status are significant predictors of no OPV and/or OPV dropout in Pakistan. Among provinces, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Sindh are the lagging provinces.
   Conclusion: Improving the socio-economic status of women helps decrease the chance of polio dropout and thus improves service delivery and program implementation. (C) 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the middle of 2003, disagreement over the safety of the oral polio vaccine pitted ordinary citizens and community leaders in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria against the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and Nigeria's federal authorities. During the crisis that ensued, five northern states (Niger, Bauchi, Kano, Zamfara and Kaduna) banned the use of the controversial vaccine on children in their respective domains. Underpinning Obadare's paper is the assumption that the immunization crisis is best understood after considering developments in the broader politico-religious contexts, both local and global. Thus, he locates the controversy as a whole against the background of the deepening interface between health and politics. He suggests that the crisis is best seen as emanating from a dearth of trust in social intercourse between ordinary citizens and the Nigerian state on the one hand, and between the same citizens and international health agencies and pharmaceutical companies on the other. The analysis of trust is historically embedded in order to illuminate the dynamics of relations among the identified actors.

TI Differences in Polio Mortality by Socioeconomic Status in Two Southern

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY

AB The collective polio literature of the mid-twentieth century developed a model centered on age at infection. In this model, known as the hygiene hypothesis, risk of severe polio increased with socioeconomic status (SES) because higher SES was associated with older age at infection. Rural residence was also linked to increased polio risk due to older age at infection. Crowding and larger family size were associated with earlier age at infection and thus reduced the risk of severe polio. In contrast, according to the intensive-exposure hypothesis proposed by Nielsen and colleagues (2001, 2002), exposure to the poliovirus within the home was linked to increased severity of infection, making larger family size and crowding important risk factors. Data for polio deaths in Wentworth and York counties, including the cities of Hamilton and Toronto, from 1900 to 1937 were gathered from a variety of archival sources and socioeconomic class was coded using the five-point composite score scale from Hauser (1982). The results provide support for the intensive-exposure hypothesis as an addition to the traditional polio model. Age at death increased with status score during the earlier 1900-1929 period, but not in the 1930-1937 period. The overall proportions of polio deaths in the various status scores were stable over both periods and disproportionately prevalent in status score three (skilled blue collar). This analysis of polio mortality provides a more nuanced picture of the disease and its relation to SES in a time of rapidly changing socioecological conditions.

AB We offer an example of modeling that influenced global health policy related to polio and we provide some insights about the modeling process. Although system dynamics lies at the heart of our modeling, we emphasize that downplaying the modeling to focus on the policy questions played a critical role in the use of the results by decision makers. Here we provide details of the system dynamics modeling that underlies our research on polio, and discuss the process we followed to bring scientific modeling of a highly complex issue to policymakers. We hope that providing a better understanding of our efforts and describing our continuing analytical journey provides useful insights for others who seek to use system dynamics to develop policies that matter.

AB Background: Post-polio syndrome (PPS) has been traditionally considered a slowly progressive condition that affects poliomyelitis survivors decades after their initial infection. Cerebral changes in poliomyelitis survivors are poorly characterised and the few existing studies are strikingly conflicting.
   Objective: The overarching aim of this study is the comprehensive characterisation of cerebral grey and white matter alterations in poliomyelitis survivors with reference to healthy- and disease-controls using quantitative imaging metrics.
   Methods: Thirty-six poliomyelitis survivors, 88 patients with ALS and 117 healthy individuals were recruited in a prospective, single-centre neuroimaging study using uniform MRI acquisition parameters. All participants underwent standardised clinical assessments, T1-weighted structural and diffusion tensor imaging. Whole-brain and region-of-interest morphometric analyses were undertaken to evaluate patterns of grey matter changes. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed to evaluate diffusivity alterations in a study-specific whiter matter skeleton.
   Results: In contrast to healthy controls, poliomyelitis survivors exhibited increased grey matter partial volumes in the brainstem, cerebellum and occipital lobe, accompanied by increased FA in the corticospinal tracts, cerebellum, bilateral mesial temporal lobes and inferior frontal tracts. Polio survivors exhibited increased integrity metrics in the same anatomical regions where ALS patients showed degenerative changes.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate considerable cortical and white matter reorganisation in poliomyelitis survivors which may be interpreted as compensatory, adaptive change in response to severe lower motor neuron injury in infancy.

AB Objective: To investigate perceived health and its relation to residual paresis from polio, late onset neuromuscular symptoms following poliomyelitis (LSP), and sex, in a population based sample of polio survivors.
   Methods: 350 subjects traced from the notification records of the Dutch 1956 polio epidemic received a mailed questionnaire on residual polio paresis and new neuromuscular symptoms. Perceived health was measured using the Nottingham health profile. Respondents with new muscle weakness and new neuromuscular symptoms were considered as cases with LSP.
   Results: Health problems were perceived by 151 of the 260 respondents. Respondents with residual paresis had significantly more health problems than clinically recovered respondents for the Nottingham health profile category of physical mobility. The perceived health of respondents with LSP (45.5%) was significantly worse than that of respondents without LSP for all the health profile categories. Among the respondents with LSP, health status did not differ between those with residual paresis and those who had recovered, except for physical mobility. Female respondents with LSP reported worse health status than male respondents with regard to physical mobility and social isolation.
   Conclusions: In this population based sample, health problems were frequently reported. They were mainly related to late onset neuromuscular symptoms following poliomyelitis, which were perceived by a substantial proportion of all polio survivors-not only subjects with polio residuals but also individuals who (subjectively) had recovered from polio.

AB Polio provocation has concerned health professionals for nearly a century. Before an effective polio vaccine was licensed in 1955, evidence that certain paediatric injections could precipitate a polio infection and severe forms of paralysis informed medical debates, experiments and shifts in public health policy. This article explores how the theory was received and approached in the United States and the consequences of its protracted resolution. It contends that although medical professionals sought to maximise health benefits for American citizens, varying conceptions of what constituted an appropriate balance of risk inspired diverse health policy outcomes.

AB Objective: This paper aims to contribute to the definition of ancient rare diseases in skeletons displaying pathologies associated with paralysis. It uses a new suite of methods, which can be applied to challenging cases of possible paralysis in archaeologically-derived human skeletal material, specifically applied to the identification of poliomyelitis.
   Materials: An adult male skeleton from Roman Halbturn, Austria. Methods: Morphological and entheseal change analyses, CT scans, X-rays, cross-section morphology, and histology, alongside modern clinical, as well as historic, literature were used to discuss paralyses.
   Results: The results suggest a diagnosis of poliomyelitis; now considered a rare disease, but perhaps ubiquitous in antiquity, thus complicating the definition of 'rare disease'.
   Conclusions: The integrated methodological procedures employed for this case constitutes a replicable and thorough approach to diagnosis, and explores the nature of ancient rare diseases. Due to the socio-environmental aspects of poliomyelitis transmission, it is likely that polio was likely not rare in the past. Therefore, the definition of 'rare diseases in the past' must include rarely occurring rarely diagnosed diseases due to biases and challenges within the archaeological and environmental record.
   Significance: The developed suite of methods has not been applied to establish a diagnosis of polio in the past. Limitations: The individual considered in this study is fairly well-preserved; thus, this set of analyses may not be applicable to all remains where preservation is poor or highly fragmentary, and the discussion of rare diseases requires relatively secure diagnoses and context.
   Suggestions for further research: Large collections and series of skeletal human remains are recommended to develop definitive conclusions.

AB Surveillance for poliovirus during the polio endgame remains uncertain. Building on prior modeling of the potential for undetected poliovirus transmission for conditions like those in Pakistan and Afghanistan, we use a hypothetical model to explore several key characteristics of the poliovirus environmental surveillance (ES) system (e.g., number and quality of sites, catchment sizes, and sampling frequency) and characterize their impacts on the time required to reach high (i.e., 95%) confidence about no circulation (CNC95%) following the last detected case of serotype 1 wild poliovirus. The nature and quality of the existing and future acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and ES system significantly impact the estimated CNC95% for places like Pakistan and Afghanistan. The analysis illustrates the tradeoffs between number of sites, sampling frequency, and catchments sizes, and suggests diminishing returns of increasing these three factors beyond a point that depends on site quality and the location of sites. Limitations in data quality and the hypothetical nature of the model reduce the ability to assess the extent to which actual ES systems offer benefits that exceed their costs. Thus, although poliovirus ES may help to reduce the time required to reach high confidence about the absence of undetected circulation, the effect strongly depends on the ability to establish effective ES sites in high-risk areas. The costs and benefits of ES require further analysis.

AB Aims: The present study was carried out to impart correct health education regarding polio eradication programme and to assess the impact of social mobilization of a Muslim community carried out by medical interns.
   Methods: One round of a polio immunization campaign was selected randomly. Five highly resistant areas were included in the study. During house to house A-Team activity, teams of health workers visited the houses and resistant families were identified. These families refused to give polio drops to their children.
   On the second day of A-Team activity, medical interns visited those identified resistant families. They imparted correct health education and tried to convince them to give polio drops. However, after prolonged persuasion, some of the families were not ready to give polio drops. These more resistant families were again visited by more motivated and enthusiastic teams during B-Team activity, started two to three days after the completion of A-Team activity. Data were collected, tabulated and analysed.
   Results: Total number of resistant families identified during house to house A-Team activity was 1025 in five high risk areas of Aligarh, India. Out of 1025 resistant houses, 510 (49.76%) houses were converted to P houses where polio drops were given to the children. Five hundred and fifteen (50.24%) houses remained resistant even after social mobilization by A-Team members. These most resistant houses were again visited by B-team members. Out of these 515 houses, polio drops were administered in 303 (58.83%). The overall number of converted houses was 813 (79.32%) after A and B-team activities. 20.68% of families remained resistant and their children could not be given polio drops.
   Conclusions: In all high risk areas, maximum numbers of resistant houses were converted to P houses. These families were persuaded and convinced by the teams of interns, social workers and influential persons that polio drops did not have any side effects. They were more receptive to the advice given by medical interns compared to other staff members of the Government District Hospital because of quality of health services provided to the community. There is a need to impart correct health education regarding importance of polio drops and routine immunization more vigorously through information, education and communication (IEC) activities.

AB The Polio Eradication Initiative, the largest coordinated public health project in history, is currently facing serious difficulties. For years, it has tried and failed to eliminate polio from its last strongholds in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Drawing on document analysis as well as participant observation and interviews in Pakistan, Atlanta, Geneva, and Montreal, I explore how officials in the Polio Eradication Initiative systematically devalued or quieted evidence that eradication was not achievable and emphasized evidence that it was achievable, thus creating a string of optimistic projections. Polio eradication's culture of optimism ensures the continuation of the project by convincing donors and officials alike that eradication is immanent. At the same time, it prevents open, objective analysis of the problems the project faces.

TI Implementation fidelity of village health and nutrition days in Hardoi
   District, Uttar Pradesh, India: a cross-sectional survey

AB Background Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs) are a cornerstone of the Government of India's strategy to provide first-contact primary health care to rural areas. Recent government programmes such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Mission Indradhanush (MI) have catalysed important changes impacting VHNDs. To learn how VHNDs are currently being delivered, we assessed the fidelity of services provided as compared to government norms in a priority district of Uttar Pradesh. Methods We fielded a cross-sectional study of VHNDs to provide a snapshot of health services functioning. Process evaluation data were collected via administrative sources, non-participant observation using a standardised form, and structured questionnaires. Questionnaires were designed using a framework to assess implementation fidelity. Key respondents were VHND participants, front-line workers involved in VHND delivery, and VHND non-participants (pregnant women due for antenatal care or children due for vaccination as per administrative records). Results were summarised as counts, frequencies, and proportions. Results In the 30 villages randomly selected for inclusion, 36 VHNDs were scheduled but four (11.1%) were cancelled and one VHND was not surveyed. Vaccination and antenatal care were offered at 96.8% (30/31) and child weighing at 83.9% (26/31) of VHNDs. Other normed services were infrequently provided or completely absent. Health education and promotion were particularly weak; institutional delivery was the only topic discussed in a majority of VHNDs. The true proportion of any serious problem impeding vaccine delivery was 47.2% (17/36), comprising 4 VHND cancellations and 13 VHNDs experiencing vaccine shortages. Of the 13 incidents of vaccine shortage, 11 related to an unexpected global shortage of injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Over the 31 VHNDs, 37.8% (171 of the 452 scheduled beneficiaries) did not participate. Analysis of missed opportunities for vaccination highlighted inaccuracies in beneficiary identification and tracking and demand side-factors. Conclusions The transformative potential of VHNDs to improve population health is only partially being met. A core subset of high-priority services for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and vaccination associated with high-priority government programmes (JSY, MI) is now being provided quite successfully. Other basic health promotion and prevention services are largely not provided, constituting a critical missed opportunity.

AB Purpose: To describe the experiences of growing up after acute paralytic poliomyelitis and strategies used to adapt to the new situation. Methods: Seven women and seven men (mean age 70 years, min-max 61-78 years) with late effects of polio, who had contracted paralytic polio in their childhood. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by systematic text condensation. Results: Memories of contracting acute paralytic poliomyelitis involved being immobilized and sent away from home for surgical and physiotherapeutic treatment. Growing up in a social context that was often tough and unfriendly resulted in the development of strategies, such as optimistic thinking, trying to blend in, trusting one's ability to manage, and to handle the preconceptions and expectations of others. At the onset of late effects of polio, some of these strategies were still functioning, whereas overachieving, disregarding pain, and weariness were not. Conclusion: The challenges of growing up with a disability following paralytic polio led to the development of various psychological strategies for managing daily life. By understanding these experiences and strategies, knowledge may be gained in assisting rehabilitation professionals to better support persons with late effects of polio in adapting to the new situation.

AB Although previous polio infection remains a considerable cause of long-term morbidity worldwide, few studies have examined the psychiatric consequences of poliomyelitis. The authors followed 4,660 polio patients hospitalized at the primary infectious disease hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, between 1922 and 1954 as well as 19,017 age- and gender-matched Danes for psychiatric hospitalizations from January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1993. Incidence rates of all psychiatric disorders combined and of separate diagnostic groups of psychiatric diseases in the two cohorts were compared, yielding the incidence rate ratio, a measure of relative risk. Overall, polio patients had a 40% increased risk of being hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder ( incidence rate ratio = 1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 1.66). Apparently, the overall increased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations could not be confined to specific groups of psychiatric disorders but seemed to be explained by slightly increased risks of several different disorders, especially milder psychiatric disorders. Finally, psychiatric morbidity did not differ between paralytic and nonparalytic polio patients. History of hospitalization for polio might be associated with subsequent risk of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders. The underlying mechanism for this association remains uncertain.

TI SERODIFFERENTIATION OF POLIOVIRUS STRAINS FOR STUDIES OF ORAL VACCINE
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Antigenic characterization of an individual isolate from a single poliomyelitis patient, who had been vaccinated with oral poliovirus vaccine or who had been a contact of a vaccinated person, may not provide clear-cut evidence for or against the causal association of type 1 oral vaccine virus and disease. Interpretation is dependent upon factors such as time between administration of vaccine (or contact with a vaccinated person) and collection of specimens from which viruses had been isolated and antigenic characteristics of known "wild" type 1 polio-viruses, which may have been collected in the same area prior to a community vaccination program. An additional problem is interference between enteroviruses in the human host. If an individual infected with type x is susceptible to and is exposed to type y, 1 of 3 possible results will be observed: x and y may multiply and be excreted together; x may prevent infection by y and continue to be excreted alone; or y may displace x as a single infection and then y may be excreted alone. Which of these alter -natives occurs probably depends upon factors such as those mentioned above. Thus, if an individual is infected with a wild poliovirus (or other enterovirus) and in the incubation period of that infection is vaccinated with oral poliovirus vaccine of adifferent viral type, the vaccine strain may displace the "wild" strain by the time illness due to the wild strain develops and the poliovirus isolated from a fecal specimen collected after the diagnosis of poliomyelitis has been made may thus be found to have the antigenic characteristics of the vaccine strain, which nevertheless may have played no role in the pathogenesis of the illness. Despite difficulties, antigenic serodifferentiation of poliovirus isolates from patients who have had contact with oral poliovirus vaccine provides valuable data in studies of the possible role of oral vaccines as the etiologic agents of disease, as it did in studies of the epidemic of 1958-59 in Leopoldville, Congo (19), and that of 1960 in Berlin, Germany (20).

AB Despite a strong global commitment, polio eradication efforts continue now more than 30 years after the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution that established the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), and 20 years after the original target of the year 2000. Prior health economic analyses estimated incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 40-50 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars (US$2008, equivalent to 48-59 billion US$2019), assuming the achievement of polio eradication by 2012. Given the delays in achieving polio eradication and increased costs, we performed an updated economic analysis of the GPEI using an updated integrated global model, and considering the GPEI trajectory as of the beginning of 2020. Applying similar methods and assuming eradication achievement in 2023, we estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 28 billion US$2019, which falls below the prior estimate. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with the widescale introduction of relatively expensive inactivated poliovirus vaccine significantly increased the costs of the GPEI and make it less cost-effective, although the GPEI continues to yield expected incremental net benefits at the global level when considered over the time horizon of 1988-2029. The overall health and financial benefits of the GPEI will depend on whether and when the GPEI can achieve its goals, when eradication occurs, the valuation method applied, and the path dependence of the actions taken. Reduced expected incremental net benefits of the GPEI and the substantial economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic pose large financial risks for the GPEI.

AB Background A rapid increase in circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 outbreaks, and the need to reserve inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for routine immunisation, has increased the value of fractional dose IPV (fIPV) as a measure to prevent acute flaccid paralysis. However, the intradermal route of administration has been viewed as prohibitive to outbreak response campaigns. We aimed to establish the immunogenicity and safety of administering intradermal fIPV with a disposable syringe jet injector (DSJI) or an intradermal adaptor (IDA) compared with standard administration with a BCG needle and syringe (N&S). Methods This pragmatic, non-inferiority trial was undertaken in a campaign setting in communities in The Gambia. Children aged 4-59 months without contraindication to vaccination were eligible. Children were not individually randomly assigned; instead, the vaccination teams were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three administration methods. Parents and the field team were not masked, but laboratory personnel were masked. Baseline demographic and anthropometric data were collected from the participants. Public health officers experienced at intradermal immunisation, and nurses without experience, had 2 h of training on each of the administration methods before the campaign. Participants were vaccinated using the administration method in use by the vaccination team in their community. Poliovirus serum neutralising antibodies (SNA) were measured in children aged 24-59 months before and 4 weeks after vaccination. Adverse events and data on injection quality were collected from all participants. The primary outcome was the type 2 immune response rate (seroconversion in seronegative [SNA titre <8] children plus a 4-fold titre rise in seropositive children). Adjusted differences in the immune response between the DSJI or IDA group versus the N&S group were calculated with 97middot5% CIs. A margin of -10% was used to define the non-inferiority of DSJI or IDA compared to N&S. Immunogenicity analysis was done per protocol. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02967783 and has been completed. Findings Between Oct 28 and Dec 29, 2016, 3189 children aged 4-59 months were recruited, of whom 3170 were eligible. Over 3 days, 2720 children were vaccinated (N&S, 917; IDA, 874; and DSJI, 929). Among 992 children aged 25-59 months with a baseline SNA available, 90middot1% (95% CI 86middot1-92middot9; 281/312) of those vaccinated using the DSJI had an immune response to type 2 compared with 93middot8% (90middot6-95middot8; 331/353) of those vaccinated with N&S and 96middot6% (94middot0-98middot0; 316/327) of those vaccinated with IDA. All (53/53) type 2 seronegative children seroconverted. For polio type 2, non-inferiority was shown for both the IDA (adjusted difference 0middot7% [97middot5% CI -3middot3 to 4middot7], unadjusted difference 2middot9% [-0middot9 to 6middot8]) and DSJI (adjusted difference -3middot3% [-8middot3 to 1middot5], unadjusted difference -3middot7% [-8middot7 to 1middot1]) compared with N&S. Non-inferiority was shown for type 1 and 3 for the IDA and DSJI. Neither injection quality nor the training and experience of the vaccinators had an effect on immune response. No safety concerns were reported.
   Interpretation In a campaign, intradermal fIPV is safe and generates consistent immune responses that are not dependent on vaccinator experience or injection quality when administered using an N&S, DSJI, or IDA. Countries facing vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 outbreaks should consider fIPV campaigns to boost population immunity and prevent cases of acute flaccid paralysis.

AB Scand J Caring Sci; 2013; 27; 238245 Living with polio and postpolio syndrome in the United Kingdom The term Postpolio Syndrome (PPS) is used to describe new and late manifestations of poliomyelitis that occur later in life in polio survivors. Polio had been eradicated in the United Kingdom (UK) and most of Europe, although this is not the case in all countries. Research in this area has tended to focus upon the impact of polio and PPS on health status and functional health rather than its overall effect on people's lives. This study's two main aims were to explore the ways in which polio and PPS in the UK has affected the respondents' lives and to ascertain their views about how the quality of life could be improved. The two questions were as follows: (1) How has the health of people with polio and PPS affected their quality of life? (2) What would people with polio and PPS change to improve their quality of life? Deductive content analysis using existing qualitative data from a cross-sectional survey of 336 returned questionnaires from persons with polio and PPS was carried out. The average age of the participants was 54years. Our research found that polio survivors valued social occupations and participation in family life. Our research has also shown that healthcare professionals still do not understand polio and PPS and this lack of understanding influences their clients' quality of life. Finances and accessibility of environments also influence participation in chosen occupations. Rehabilitation programmes for people with polio and PPS need to be targeted towards maintaining and improving accessible environments and participation in chosen occupations, and healthcare professionals need to ensure that persons with polio and PPS are referred to persons with specific expertise in this area.

TI School-based educational and on-site vaccination intervention among
   adolescents: study protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial

AB Introduction Childhood vaccination programmes have been established in all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; however, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) as well as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio (Tdap-IPV) vaccination rates are not optimal in adolescents. Education in combination with easy access vaccination may be a promising approach to improve vaccination rates. We aim at improving MMR and Tdap-IPV rates in a school setting in the context of a planned cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT), the present paper describes the detailed protocol of this trial.
   Methods and analysis We will conduct a school-based cRCT, where schools will be randomised to either an educational condition addressing knowledge, risk communication and enhancing self-efficacy regarding vaccination or a low-intensity information condition. In both conditions, a bus equipped with medical staff and materials, will be delivering MMR and Tdap-IPV vaccine directly after the intervention. Schools in the city centre of Berlin, Germany, will be stratified by percentage of migration and type of school. Primary outcome is the number of students who receive vaccination in the bus. Secondary outcomes are knowledge and self-efficacy. An estimated sample size of 355 school classes with approximately 25 students per class is required. The planned analyses will take the nested structure of students, classes and schools into account.
   Ethics and dissemination The study will be performed according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained by the local ethics committee. Parents of all students will be informed in advance. Their written consent will be obtained, in case students are underage. For dissemination, we will engage with governmental organisations to create potential of our educational unit to be included in future public health prevention schemes.

AB The development of international health from a historical point of view has undergone major advances in recent times and constitutes a substantial part of the current agenda for historians of medicine. Within this framework, and focussing on a specific case study (international responses to poliomyelitis outbreaks in the 20th century), we explore the main actions and achievements of agencies such as the WHO and other private and international scientific organizations. Furthermore, this paper seeks to identify the Spanish presence and absence in these activities, their causes and consequences.

TI INTRINSIC VACCINE EFFICACY OF 1954 POLIOMYELITIS VACCINE
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Clinical poliomyelitis appears to have a multiple infectious etiology and hence prophylactic field trials are conducted under conditions of mixed infection. The recently proposed measure of intrinsic vaccine efficacy (IVE), which may be roughly defined as the ratio of protection to the specific amount of infection, was evolved for such situations, and was applied to the data for the 1954 poliomyelitis vaccine field trials. It is concluded that these vaccines were indistinguishably close to 100% in intrinsic efficacy; these vaccine appeared to have prevented all of the illness that could rationally have been expected to be preventable. Hence, the finding of a polio virus infection in a subject properly vaccinated with a polio vaccine, evaluated as 100% intrinsically efficacious, may be interpreted as evidence of a subclinical infection, and similarly, the occurrence of clinical polio illness in such subjects may be regarded as due to other etiology.

AB Excitement mounts as the global health and international development communities anticipate a polio-free world. Despite substantial political and logistical hurdles, only 223 cases of wild poliovirus in three countries were reported in 2012. Down 99% from the estimated 350,000 annual cases in 125 countries in 1988 this decline signals the imminent global eradication of polio.
   However, elimination of new polio cases should not also signal an end to worldwide engagement with polio. As many as 20 million continue to live with the disabling consequences of the disease. In developed countries where polio immunization became universal after dissemination of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, almost all individuals who have had polio are now above age 50. But in many developing countries where polio vaccination campaigns reached large segments of the population only after 1988, millions disabled by polio are still children or young adults. Demographically, this group is also different. After three decades of immunization efforts, those children unvaccinated in the late 1980s were more likely to be from poorer rural and slum communities and to be girls groups not only harder to reach than more affluent members of the population but also individuals who, if they contract polio, are less likely to have access to medical and rehabilitation programs or education, job training, employment and social support services.
   The commitment to eradicate polio should not be considered complete while those living with the disabling sequelae of polio continue to live in poor health, poverty and social isolation. This paper reviews what is currently known about disabled survivors of polio and highlights areas of need in public health research, policy and programming. Based on a literature review, discussion and field observations, we identify continuing challenges posed by polio and argue that the attention, funding and commitment now being directed towards eradication be shifted to provide for the rehabilitative, medical, educational and social needs of those for whom the disabling sequelae of polio will remain a daily challenge for decades to come.

AB Objective. To assess the contribution of rapid vaccination monitoring to the achievement of vaccination coverage targets in catch-up vaccination campaigns. Methods. Data on catch-up vaccination were obtained from the database of the Directorate of Vaccine- Preventable Diseases. Data analysis was performed in Stata V.15 (R). Frequency and summary statistics were calculated; the p value was used to determine statistical significance. The change in mean coverage between interventions was assessed with Student's t-test. Results. During the catch-up campaign, 815,482 children in 157 municipalities were immunized, and 2,431 rapid monitoring activities were carried out. Prior to rapid monitoring, measles and rubella (MR) vaccine coverage was 85.7%, while bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) coverage was 89.9%; coverage was homogeneous in 78% of municipalities. After rapid monitoring, MR coverage rose to 98.7% and bOPV coverage to 100%. MR coverage increased by 14.6% and bOPV coverage by 11.7%; both changes were statistically significant (Student's t-test: 12.3 and 10.8, respectively; P = 0). Conclusion. Rapid monitoring is a useful strategy for validating coverage during catch-up vaccination campaigns and should be carried out by outside teams. The reported data can be used to improve the accuracy of coverage data. Rapid monitoring is an appropriate strategy from a cost-benefit standpoint, and we recommend its use to assess data quality during catch-up vaccination campaigns.

AB Objective: To explore the health situation and identify specific health challenges in non-Western immigrants with polio in Norway, by comparing their status with Western immigrants with polio and native Norwegians with polio.
   Design: A questionnaire covering demographics, polio history, life satisfaction, medical, psychological and social conditions was answered by 1,408 persons with polio, among them 34 immigrants from non-Western countries and 32 immigrants from Western countries.
   Results: The non-Western immigrant polio group had a mean age of 46 years, were highly educated, reported high frequency of mental health problems and only one-third was working. Mean age for contracting polio was 2.8 years. Only 30% was hospitalized in the acute phase and 80% reported severe leg weakness. Use of a powered wheelchair was reported by 72%. Post-polio symptoms had started at a mean age of 31 years. The non-Western immigrant group reported more fatigue, pain and loneliness, and a high proportion reported insufficient assistance from the public health system.
   Conclusion: The group of non-Western immigrants with polio in Norway reported more health and social problems than the group of Western immigrants with polio or the native Norwegian group with polio, even though they were younger and more highly educated. Their complex psychological and social situation requires active intervention from the health system, and health professionals need extra skills to deal most effectively with their situation.

ID POLIOMYELITIS; INJECTIONS
AB At the beginning of the twentieth century, poliomyelitis presented a scientific and medical challenge of a complexity similar to that of AIDS now. Research on polio, mainly in the US, gradually became focussed to solving basic questions, but was held up by the lack of suitable laboratory techniques. The financing of the research and the wide range of basic topics funded were the model for later medical science. The problem of polio, at least in the wealthier temperate countries, has been solved by the use of vaccines. Many fundamental questions about the mechanism of the disease remained unsolved and this lack of knowledge has contributed to many unfortunate accidents. The history of polio has many lessons for AIDS researchers.

AB Objective: To evaluate the association between self-reported severity of polio sequelae and current functional status among polio survivors.
   Methods: This was a cross sectional study of 195 polio survivors attending a polio outpatient clinic at a university hospital. The main outcome measures of demographic, medical, social, and functional data were gleaned from a questionnaire adapted for the polio population. The severity of polio sequelae was evaluated with the self-reported Index of Post-Polio Sequelae (IPPS).
   Results: The mean age of our sample was 57.6 +/- 10.5 years, 53% were men, 38% had acquired higher education and 37% were employed. We found significant correlations between the total IPPS score and independence in activity of daily living (P < 0.05), the use of walking aids (P < 0.005) and mobility in and out-of-doors (P < 0.0001). A positive correlation was also found between the total IPPS score and subjective assessment of physical and mental health (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Higher disability in ADL and mobility and lower perception of physical and mental health in polio survivors were associated with a higher score on the IPPS, reflecting greater severity of polio sequelae. These findings demonstrate the IPPS as a useful tool in the clinical evaluation of the polio population, however further data is needed in order to determine if this index can assess clinically significant changes over time.

AB Post-poliomyelitis syndrome is defined as a clinical syndrome of new weakness, fatigue and pain which can occur several decades following recovery from paralytic poliomyelitis. The cause of this disorder is still unclear, and many possible etiologies have been proposed. The most widely accepted etiology was first proposed by Wiechers and Hubbell, which attributes PPS to a distal degeneration of massively enlarged post-polio motor units. Other probable contributing factors to the onset of this disease are the ageing process, and overuse. Currently, there is no specific diagnostic test for PPS, which continues to be a diagnosis of exclusion in an individual with symptoms and signs of the disorder.

AB In studies conducted on polio survivors with late effects of poliomyelitis, new fatigue is frequently, reported. The main purpose of the present study, was to examine the characteristics of polio survivors reporting severe fatigue versus those reporting mild or no fatigue. From a survey among 276 representative Norwegian polio survivors, we recruited all patients with mild/no fatigue and those with severe fatigue, without other diseases than poliomyelitis. Out of 276 polio survivors, 43 reported mild, 113 moderate and 118 severe fatigue (2 were missing). Only 12 with mild fatigue, 21 with moderate and 14 with severe fatigue had no other diseases and health problems related to fatigue. Six of these patients with mild/no and 9 with severe fatigue, and 16 healthy persons participated in the study. The subjects were assessed with the Fatigue Questionnaire. Fatigue Severity Scale, Visual Analog Scale for pain and fatigue, SCL-90-R, cognitive tests, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), blood and urine parameters, spirometry, exercise and muscle strength tests, 24-hour pulse registration, Sunnaas ADL-index and the Rivermead Mobility Index. The group with severe fatigue had significantly. more elevated scores on SCL-90-R, measuring obsessive-compulsive behaviour, depression and anxiety than both the mild fatigue group and the controls. They, also had higher scores on the somatization scale than the control group. No other test results showed significant differences between the mild/no and the severe fatigue polio groups. The present results give no support to the hypothesis of "brain fatigue in polio survivors, assessed by cognitive tests or ERPs. Moreover, the physical test results did not correspond to perceived fatigue. Thus. the only characteristics distinguishing polio survivors with severe fatigue from those with mild/no fatigue in this study were psychological characteristics. However, a larger group of polio survivors suffer from additional diseases, and such diseases should be ruled out during a comprehensive rehabilitation program.

AB Purpose To investigate the prevalence of fibromyalgia(FM) and to show its relations with symptoms, polio-related impairments (PRI), and quality of life (QoL) in persons with prior paralytic poliomyelitis (PsPP) with and without post-polio syndrome (PPS). Materials and methods The study included 74 PsPP under 60 years of age, 60 of whom met the criteria for PPS. Presence and severity of FM were assessed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990, 2010, and 2016 criteria, and Fibromyalgia Severity Score. PPS symptoms, PRI, and QoL were evaluated using the Self-Reported Impairments in Persons with Late Effects of Polio Rating Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Nottingham Health Profile. Frequency, comparison, and correlation analyses were performed. Results While 15% of PsPP with PPS met the criteria of ACR 1990, 32% of ACR 2010, and 35% of ACR 2016, none of those without PPS met any of the criteria for FM. Severity of PPS symptoms and PRI were significantly higher, and QoL was significantly lower in those with co-existing FM. FM severity was found to be significantly associated with severity of PPS symptoms, PRI and reduced QoL. Conclusions FM frequently coexists in PsPP with PPS and may increase the burden of PPS.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of childhood moves and foreign birth on vaccination coverage among Latino children in New York City.
   Methods. Vaccination coverage was assessed in a survey of 314 children younger than 5 years at 2 immunization clinics.
   Results. Forty-seven percent of the study children had moved abroad. After adjustment for health insurance, regular source of care, and country of birth, child moves had no independent effect on vaccination coverage. Foreign-born children had diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, oral polio vaccine, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccination coverage rates similar to those of US-born children, but they were underimmunized in regard to Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B.
   Conclusions. Foreign birth, but not childhood moves, is a barrier to vaccinations among low-income, urban Latino children.

AB The practical eradication of poliomyelitis in industrialized countries marks one of the most important achievements of world health policy. Yet, disability induced by polio not only continues to exist among survivors with paralytic sequelae, but may also be further accentuated in a considerable number of affected subjects by the development of postpolio syndrome (PPS). PPS aggravates the motor sequelae already present in such subjects and reduces their functional capacity to the point where it affects their activities of daily living and worsens their quality of life. Inasmuch as development of PPS questions the concept of poliomyelitis as a static disease it poses a challenge not only to health professionals but also to policy-makers tasked with providing the necessary health-care measures and appropriate resources. This study sought to review research on this syndrome and to draw up some recommendations that might prove useful to the health authorities for decision-making purposes.

AB Background. After 2 decades of focused efforts to eradicate polio, the impact of eradication activities on health systems continues to be controversial. This study evaluated the impact of polio eradication activities on routine immunization (RI) and primary healthcare (PHC).
   Methods.aEuro integral Quantitative analysis assessed the effects of polio eradication campaigns on RI and maternal healthcare coverage. A systematic qualitative analysis in 7 countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa assessed impacts of polio eradication activities on key health system functions, using data from interviews, participant observation, and document review.
   Results.aEuro integral Our quantitative analysis did not find compelling evidence of widespread and significant effects of polio eradication campaigns, either positive or negative, on measures of RI and maternal healthcare. Our qualitative analysis revealed context-specific positive impacts of polio eradication activities in many of our case studies, particularly disease surveillance and cold chain strengthening. These impacts were dependent on the initiative of policy makers. Negative impacts, including service interruption and public dissatisfaction, were observed primarily in districts with many campaigns per year.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral Polio eradication activities can provide support for RI and PHC, but many opportunities to do so remain missed. Increased commitment to scaling up best practices could lead to significant positive impacts.

AB Purpose. This present study describes the development, factor structure and initial validation of the Index of Post-Polio Sequelae (IPPS).
   Method. The IPPS was tested on a sample of 849 community-dwelling polio survivors between the ages of 40 and 93 years old who participated in a large, national study of menopause and aging in late polio. Items from the IPPS were submitted to a factor analysis using principal components extraction and rotated to oblique simple structure using promax rotation. Convergent validity was assessed using bivariate correlation.
   Results. Three factors were extracted that accounted for approximately 53% of the variance in the original IPPS items. Factor 1 (Pain) was loaded most heavily by two items referring to muscle and joint pain. Factor 2 (Atrophy) was loaded by items referring to muscle atrophy, involved muscle weakness, and fatigue. Factor 3 (Bulbar) was comprised of two items referring to breathing and swallowing problems. Bivariate correlations between health and psychosocial variables and each of the factors all were significant and in expected directions.
   Conclusions. This first validation of a standardized scale to assess the severity of post-polio sequelae in polio survivors suggests a psychometrically sound instrument whose factor structure represents commonly reported problems in the extant post-polio literature.

AB Through the efforts of the global campaign to eradicate poliomyelitis, polio cases have declined worldwide, from 35,251 cases in 1988, to 1449 cases as of 28 October 2005. However, confirmed cases of wild polio virus continue to be reported from Northern Nigeria. This paper examines the reasons for the difficulties in eradicating polio in Northern Nigeria from the perspective of residents of one town, Zaria, in northern Kaduna State. Research methods included participant observation, open-ended interviews and the collection of polio-related documents. While some people believed that the vaccine was contaminated by anti-fertility substances, others questioned the focus on polio when measles and malaria were considered more harmful. Some also distrusted claims about the safety of Western biomedicine. These concerns relate to questions about the appropriateness of vertical health interventions, where levels of routine immunization are low. While the Polio Eradication Initiative was considered to be cost-effective by Western donors, from the perspective of some people in Zaria it was seen as undermining primary health care, suggesting that a collaborative, community-based framework for primary health care, which includes routine immunization, would be a more acceptable approach.

TI PARALLEL DILEMMAS: POLIO TRANSMISSION AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN
   NIGERIA
SO AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
ID ERADICATION; CAMPAIGN; SMALLPOX; VACCINE; BOYCOTT
AB Nigeria is one of three countries where polio continues to be endemic. In northern Nigeria, areas with low levels of polio immunization due to persistent parental opposition as well as implementation and infrastructural problems have contributed to wild poliovirus transmission. Furthermore, political violence associated with Islamic groups opposed to the federal government has also hampered the conclusion of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) efforts. This violence, which began in Borno State and has spread to other parts of northern Nigeria, occurs precisely where poliovirus transmission continues. These two related aspects - parallel dilemmas of low immunization and political violence - confound the conclusion of GPEI efforts in Nigeria. This situation also raises ethical questions both about the final stages of eradication efforts and about military actions to contain ongoing violence. The Nigerian government's attempts to suppress opposition to the polio eradication campaign by threatening non-compliant parents with arrest and by closing down media outlets may frighten some parents into compliance but can also breed resentment and resistance, just as military and police activities, such as house-to-house sweeps and widespread arrests, may encourage sympathy for Islamic insurgents. This situation suggests that the possible solution of one problem - the ending of wild poliovirus transmission - depends upon a solution of the other, i.e. the cessation of violent anti-government activities.

AB We leverage the largest polio outbreak in US history, the 1916 polio epidemic, to study how epidemic-related school interruptions affect educational attainment. Using polio morbidity as a proxy for epidemic exposure, we find that children aged 10 and under, and school-aged children of legal working age with greater exposure to the epidemic experienced reduced educational attainment compared to their slightly older peers. These reductions in observed educational attainment persist even after accounting for the influenza epidemic of 1918.

TI Maternal Correlates of Poliomyelitis Vaccination Uptake: Evidence from

AB Poliomyelitis (polio) is a communicable viral disease that mainly affects under-5 children. This study focuses on the impact of women's empowerment and women's working status on the uptake of polio vaccination of children in polio-endemic countries, including Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Nigeria, the latter of which has recently been declared polio-free. The polio vaccination status can be divided into no vaccination (NV), incomplete vaccination (IV), and complete vaccination. We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) rounds for this manuscript. Multinomial logistic regression-based estimates suggest that mothers' working status, empowerment, age, education, father's education, and household wealth status reduce the risk of NV and IV in the polio-endemic countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) and Nigeria. In addition, the mothers' working status, empowerment, age, education, and father's education increase the child's healthcare information that helps complete polio vaccination of the child. On the other hand, the children whose mothers work in the agriculture sector or are engaged in a blue-collar job are more likely to remain unvaccinated than women in white-collar jobs. Similarly, mothers engaged in government jobs are more likely to get their children fully vaccinated than unemployed mothers. Thus, as a child's polio vaccination is strongly dependent on a mother's working status and empowerment, the focus of public policy on empowering women and promoting their labor force participation may increase polio vaccination uptake, besides adopting other measures to increase immunization.

AB Background: During 2013, isolation of a wild type 1 poliovirus from routine sewage sample in Israel, led to a national OPV campaign: During this period, there was a constant cover of the outbreak by the mass media. Aims: To investigate the association of media exposure and OPV and non-OPV vaccines uptake during the,2013 silent polio outbreak in Israel.
   Methods: We received data on daily immunization rates during the outbreak period from the Ministry of Health (MoH). We conducted a multivariable time trend analysis to assess the association between daily media exposure and vaccines uptake. Analysis was stratified by ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES).
   Results: During the MoH supplemental immunization activity, 138,799 OPV vaccines were given. There r was a significant association between media exposure and OPV uptake, most prominent in a lag of 3-5 days from the exposUre among Jews (R.R 1.79C.195% 1.32-2.41) and high SES subgroups (R.R 1.71C.I 95% 1.27:2.30). These subgroups also showed increased non-OPV uptake in a lag of 3-5 days from the media exposure, in all vaccines except for MMR. Lower SES and non-Jewish subgroups did not demonstrate the same association.
   Conclusion: Our findings expand the understanding of public behaviour during outbreaks. The public response shows high variability within specific subgroups. These findings highlight the importance of tailored communication strategies for each subgroup. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Thirty Years of Experience of Acute Flaccid Paralysis Surveillance for
   Polio - China, 1993-2022
SO CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction : Detecting poliovirus infections proves to be highly challenging due to their asymptomatic nature and infectious potential, highlighting the crucial importance of effective detection methods in the context of polio eradication efforts. In many countries, including China, the primary approach for identifying polio outbreaks has been through acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. In this study, we conducted an evaluation spanning three decades (1993-2022) to assess the effectiveness of AFP surveillance in China. Methods : Data on all AFP cases identified since 1993 and national -level AFP surveillance system quality indicators aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) standards were collected for analysis. The quality indicators assess surveillance sensitivity, completeness, timeliness of detection notification, case investigation, and laboratory workup. Surveillance sensitivity is determined by the non -polio AFP (NPAFP) detection rate among children under 15 years of age. Results : Between 1993 and 2022, a total of 150,779 AFP cases were identified and reported. Within this pool, surveillance identified 95 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) and 24 cases due to vaccinederived poliovirus. From 1995 onwards, the detection rate of NPAFP cases consistently adhered to the WHO and national standards of >= 1 case per 100,000, falling between 1.38 and 2.76. Starting in 1997, all timeliness indicators consistently achieved the criteria of 80 % , apart from the consistency in meeting standards set for the rate of positive specimens sent to the national laboratory. Conclusions : AFP surveillance has been instrumental in China's accomplishment of maintaining a polio -free status. The ongoing adherence to key performance indicators, ensuring sensitivity and prompt specimen collection, demonstrates that AFP surveillance is proficient in detecting poliovirus in China. As we move into the post -eradication phase, AFP surveillance remains crucial for the sustained absence of polioviruses in the long term.

AB Background: Articles in the literature describing the association between body composition and osteoporosis in subjects with poliomyelitis are scarce.
   Objective: To assess the relationship between body composition and femoral neck osteoporosis or osteopenia in adults with previous polio.
   Method: After excluding postmenopausal women, 44 polio (mean age +/- standard deviation, 46.1 +/- 3.3 years) and 44 able-bodied control volunteers (47.0 +/- 4.0 years) participated in the study. Each participant's femoral neck bone mineral density (FNBMD) and whole body composition were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. With local reference BMD values of normal young adults installed in the instrument, we obtained T-score values that depended on each FNBMD value. A T-score value of <= -1.0 indicated decreased T-score, including osteoporosis (T-score <= -2.5) and osteopenia (-1.0 to -2.5). This study conducted logistic regression analyses to find factors associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia.
   Results: Based on the FNBMD T-score values, 60.0% of middle-aged men with polio had osteoporosis. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, total lean tissue mass (Adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.74 [0.56-0.99], P < 0.05) and male gender (947.16 [6.02-148,926.16], P < 0.01) were important factors associated with decreased T-score in polio group.
   Conclusions: Osteoporosis or osteopenia is a common medical problem for middle-aged men with polio. Reduced total lean tissue mass seems to be one of the important factors associated with osteoporosis or osteopenia among subjects with polio. Further research for a clinical tool to assess lean tissue mass for subjects with polio is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: More than 7000 patients developed poliomyelitis during the main epidemic in the fifties in Israel. In recent years, there is a further deterioration in their condition due to accelerated aging process and post-polio syndrome.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk factors for the progression of functional status in a cohort of patients with late effect of poliomyelitis over a period of ten years.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study including 82 individuals with late effect of poliomyelitis evaluated over ten years. Mean age was 67 +/- 8.5 years, 52.4% were men and 79.3% were Jewish. Functional status was evaluated by activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaire. Risk factors, including general comorbidities, history of poliomyelitis infection, use of assistive devices, employment, and physical activity statuses were evaluated using specific questionnaires.
   RESULTS: Independence in ADL functions deteriorated significantly over ten years. Older age, ethnicity, use of a wheelchair, and use of orthotic devices in childhood were risk factors for deterioration in ADL function. No correlation was found between the presence of other comorbidities or poliomyelitis parameters and worsening of ADL functions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Late effect of poliomyelitis was associated with deterioration in ADL functions probably due to the combined effect of the initial severity of the paralytic poliomyelitis symptoms and accelerated aging.

AB Purpose. To compare the strength and endurance of knee extensors in subjects after paralytic poliomyelitis as well as to extend the comparison to healthy subjects.
   Method Twenty subjects after poliomyelitis with new symptoms (SYM group), 10 without new symptoms (ASYM group) and 15 healthy controls were included. To determine strength, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of knee extensors in both legs was determined by Biodex (R) dynamometer at 60 degrees knee angle. To determine endurance, the subjects were asked to mantain force in the knee extensors in the same position, in the range between 40-45% of MVC torque, as long as possible. The 'tensiomyography' method was applied to measure the radial displacement of m. rectus femoris during submaximal continuous electrical stimulation until recording a flat response.
   Results. No significant difference in MVC torque and endurance was found between SYM and ASYM group, as well between the duration of m. rectus femoris response of both groups to submaximal electrical stimulation. MVC torque and endurance of knee extensors with 'normal' strength was significantly lower in post-polio subjects compared to healthy controls.
   Conclusion. Endurance of knee extensor muscles in post-polio subjects is generally and significantly lower than that of knee extensors in healthy subjects, regardless of the implication of normal strength and subjective observations of post-polio subjects.

AB The prevalence of distress in aspects of perceived health and its relation to involvement of poliomyelitis sequelae were studied with the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) in 113 outpatients (mean age 57 years). The leisure and employment situation was also recorded. Most distress was found in the NHP dimensions physical mobility, pain and energy, and least distress in social isolation. Most health-related problems were reported in housework, employment and leisure. Three-quarters of the persons were satisfied with their leisure, although many of them had problems. Fifty-nine per cent of the subjects of working age were in gainful employment, and no difference in employment rate due to the distribution of polio involvement was found. In comparison with norm values for the respective age groups, the subjects with poliomyelitis sequelae aged below 45 and 45-65 years had more distress in a larger number of NHP dimensions than older subjects.

DE surveillance; polio; endemic; Pakistan; Afghanistan
AB Poliomyelitis has been eliminated from all countries of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan. One of the major reasons is the stigmas associated with the polio vaccine that has been repetitively discussed in literature, and governments of both the countries are already making serious efforts to control this public health challenge, but till this moment, the state officials have not introduced any surveillance strategy for the security of polio workers in National Emergency Action Plan (NEAP) for Polio Eradication. This report highlights the issue of targeted killing and terrorism attacks on polio vaccinators in Pakistan and also devises a surveillance strategy to provide security to polio workers at immediate possible because the current chaos in Afghanistan will ultimately lead to more terrorist attacks on polio vaccinators.

AB This study examined differences between depressed and nondepressed individuals with a history of paralytic poliomyelitis in terms of demographics, health status and coping strategies. The prevalence of distress and depression in this group of 116 polio survivors was determined. Subjects completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Coping with Disability Inventory and a questionnaire concerning their polio histories and self-perceptions of health. Medical assessments were performed by physicians. Only 15.8% of the sample had scores indicating depression and elevated distress. Depressed/distressed polio survivors were more likely to: be living alone, be experiencing further health status deterioration, seek professional help, view their health as poor, report greater pain, be less satisfied with their occupational status and their lives in general and exhibit poorer coping outcome behaviors in relation to their disability. Three factors in coping with the late effects of polio were identified through a factor analysis of the Coping with Disability Inventory: positive self-acceptance, information seeking/sharing about the disability and social activism. Differences between depressed/distressed and other polio survivors were found across these three factors, with depressed/distressed subjects having significantly lower coping scores. These and other results are discussed.

AB In the 1940s nurses in the United States set out to learn the Kenny method of treating polio patients, which relied on hot packs and muscle strengthening exercises instead of the standard system of prolonged immobilization. Named for Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian nurse who based herself in Minnesota during the 1940s and early 1950s, and viewed with suspicion by many physicians, nurses, and physical therapists, the treatment nonetheless proved effective. It changed the practice of polio nursing and the experiences of patients in the years before vaccine prevention largely eliminated paralytic polio.

AB Patients with previous polio represent a challenge for neurological rehabilitation. We examined 168 previous polio patients and 239 of their siblings, the patients either from the 1950-1954 epidemic cohort, or from a cohort of hospital-admitted rehabilitation patients. Ninety-four paralytic patients and 74 non-paralytic patients were included. All patients and siblings answered the same questionnaires for socioeconomic and health factors and chi-square comparisons were performed. Previous polio did not affect the level of education. Both patients and siblings rated their educational options to have been good. Significantly less patients were full-time employed at the age of 40 years compared to their siblings (P =0.015). This was the result of a lower full-time employment rate amongst the paralytic patients, only 52% of this group being employed full-time. Male patients and paralytic patients reported to have experienced reduced professional options. More patients were living alone compared to their siblings (P =0.035). The perception of general health was lower amongst patients than siblings, as was assessment of total life situation and patients reported more frequently symptoms like pain and tiredness. In conclusion, previous polio had not lowered the polio patients' educational status, but fewer patients were employed full-time at the age of 40 years.

DT Article
AB A summary account of the activities of the Polio Surveillance Unit, Communicable Disease Center, Public Health Service, U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare is given with an epidemiologic evaluation of the use of poliomyelitis vaccine in the United States in 1955. A study was made of cases of polio occurring after inoculation with Cutter vaccine, and it was concluded that the development of the disease, in some of these cases, was the result of the presence in infective amounts, of live polio virus in some distribution lots of Cutter vaccine. No evidence has come to light to incriminate any lot of vaccine released since safety tests were revised in May, 1955. Preliminary reports from a number of states indicate encouraging results regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine. Attack rates for paralytic polio are from 2 to more than 5 times greater in the unvaccinated than in the vaccinated groups of children. Confirmation of these preliminary findings has been obtained from a study of the pattern of the age distribution of cases of polio, which shows a sharp reduction in paralytic attack rates among 7 and 8 year old children in comparison to expected rates based on past experience.

AB In Sweden alone, there are today approximately 10 000-16 500 polio survivors. Between 60% and 80% experience new symptoms several years after the initial attack of poliomyelitis. The aims of this study were to investigate and describe the self-rated health-related quality of life and functional status of a group of Swedish patients with post-polio, to investigate whether any differences within the group could be related to demographic or disease-specific data and to compare the post-polio patients with individuals sampled from the general population. Data were obtained by using two questionnaires, the Swedish Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWED-QUAL) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). A total of 150 patients, 86 women and 64 men with median age 61 (20-82) years, were consecutively included. The study showed that the patients mainly reported that their physical, functional status was affected by their post-polio condition. Factors found to be associated with the physical, functional status were age and the number of parts of the body affected by the polio. On comparing the post-polio patients with two samples from the Swedish general population, it was found that the patients reported a poorer functional status and health-related quality of life. The women with post-polio reported more pain, as compared with both the men with post-polio and the women in the general population sample. The family life of the patients - in contrast to their physical abilities - did not seem to be affected by the new deteriorating condition. It is concluded that, owing to the wide range of symptoms, the patients with post-polio need care and support from multidisciplinary teams, including nurses and occupational therapists.

TI Partition and Poliomyelitis: An Investigation of the Polio Disparity
   Affecting Muslims during India's Eradication Program
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   Significant disparities in the incidence of polio existed during its eradication campaign in India. In 2006, Muslims, who comprise 16% of the population in affected states, comprised 70% of paralytic polio cases. This disparity was initially blamed on the Muslims and a rumor that the vaccination program was a plot to sterilize their children. Using the framework of structural violence, this paper describes how the socio-political and historical context of Muslim populations in India shaped the polio disparity.
   Methods and Findings
   A qualitative study utilizing methods of rapid ethnography was conducted from May-August 2009 in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India. Field methods included participant observation of vaccination teams, historical document research, and 107 interviews with both Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) stakeholders and families with vaccine-eligible children. Almost all respondents agreed that Aligarh was a highly segregated city, mostly due to riots after Partition and during the 1990s. Since the formation of segregated neighborhoods, most respondents described that "Muslim areas" had been underdeveloped compared to "Hindu areas," facilitating the physical transmission of poliovirus. Distrust of the government and resistance to vaccination were linked to this disparate development and fears of sterilization influenced by the "Family Planning Program" from 1976-1977.
   Conclusions
   Ethnic violence and social marginalization since the Partition and during the rise of Hindu nationalism led to distrust of the government, the formation of segregated slums, and has made Muslims victims of structural violence. This led to the creation of disease-spreading physical environments, lowered vaccine efficacy, and disproportionately higher levels of resistance to vaccination. The causes of the polio disparity found in this study elucidate the nature of possible other health disparities affecting minorities in India.
   Limitations
   This study is limited by the manual coding of the transcribed data, size, and some dialectal difficulties in translation.

ID MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; RISK-FACTORS; DELAYED

AB Objectives. This study examined the relationship between acculturation levels of poor Latina women in Los Angeles and their children's immunization status. Receipt of three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and two doses of oral polio vaccine by the age of 12 months was considered adequate immunization.
   Methods. Household interviews were conducted in East Los Angeles and South Central Los Angeles with mothers (n = 688) about one randomly selected child aged It to 36 months,
   Results. One fourth of the children were inadequately immunized. Less-acculturated mothers were more likely to have adequately immunized children. inadequate prenatal care, absence of close family members, the child's birth position as other than firstborn, and more than one family relocation during the child's lifetime were associated with inadequate immunization.
   Conclusions. The findings challenge the notion that children of recent immigrants bear a higher risk of underimmunization.

   VWA focuses on the work of national immunization programs, with special efforts to reach the unreached. This paper offers examples of how countries have leveraged VWA to implement a diverse array of vaccination activities, strengthening overall health services by integrating with other preventive health interventions, and bolstering "Pan-Americanism" and health diplomacy.
   The opportunities offered by this global initiative were clearly demonstrated in April 2016 when the successful global switch from the trivalent oral polio vaccine to the bivalent vaccine was synchronized with WIW. Going forward, VWA and WIW can help close the gaps in access to immunization and other health services, contributing to achieve universal health coverage.

AB Beginning in 2013, multiple local government areas (LGAs) in Borno and Yobe in northeast Nigeria and other parts of the Lake Chad basin experienced a violent insurgency that resulted in substantial numbers of isolated and displaced people. Northeast Nigeria represents the last known reservoir country of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission in Africa, with detection of paralytic cases caused by serotype 1 WPV in 2016 in Borno and serotype 3 WPV in late 2012. Parts of Borno and Yobe are also problematic areas for transmission of serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, and they continue to face challenges associated with conflict and inadequate health services in security-compromised areas that limit both immunization and surveillance activities. We model poliovirus transmission of all three serotypes for Borno and Yobe using a deterministic differential equation-based model that includes four subpopulations to account for limitations in access to immunization services and dynamic restrictions in population mixing. We find that accessibility issues and insufficient immunization allow for prolonged poliovirus transmission and potential undetected paralytic cases, although as of the end of 2019, including responsive program activities in the modeling suggest die out of indigenous serotypes 1 and 3 WPVs prior to 2020. Specifically, recent and current efforts to access isolated populations and provide oral poliovirus vaccine continue to reduce the risks of sustained and undetected transmission, although some uncertainty remains. Continued improvement in immunization and surveillance in the isolated subpopulations should minimize these risks. Stochastic modeling can build on this analysis to characterize the implications for undetected transmission and confidence about no circulation.

TI Stop! The Polio Vaccination Cessation Game

AB Should polio be eradicated worldwide, countries must decide whether to continue to vaccinate with the live-attenuated vaccine, to continue to vaccinate with the alternative, killed vaccine, or to cease vaccinating. To reap a dividend from polio eradication, countries must choose the last option, but vaccination cessation entails interdependent risks as well as rewards. This article models the polio vaccination cessation game, deriving the conditions that support vaccination cessation as an equilibrium, describing the policies and institutions needed to steer countries toward this equilibrium, and presenting crude quantitative estimates of the gains to supporting this equilibrium.

AB The objective of this project was to document and increase vaccine coverage in migrant school children on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Migrant school children (n = 12,277) were enrolled in a school-based immunization program in four Thai border districts. The children were evaluated for vaccination completion and timing, for six different vaccines: Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG); Oral Polio vaccine (OPV); Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB); Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus vaccine (DTP); Measles Containing Vaccine or Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR); Tetanus and Diphtheria containing vaccine (Td). Vaccine coverage proportions for BCG, OPV3, DTP3, HepB3 and measles containing vaccine were 92.3, 85.3, 63.8, 72.2, and 90.9 % respectively. Most children were able to receive vaccines in a time appropriate manner. School-based immunization programs offer a suitable vaccine delivery mechanism for hard-to-reach populations. However, these data suggest overall low vaccine coverage in migrant populations. Further efforts toward improving appropriate vaccine coverage and methods of retaining documentation of vaccination in mobile migrant populations are necessary for improved health.

AB In Pakistan, annual poliovirus investment decisions drive quantities of supplemental immunization campaigns districts receive. In this article, we assess whether increased spending on poliovirus surveillance is associated with greater likelihood of correctly identifying districts at high risk of polio with assignment of an elevated "risk ranking." We reviewed programmatic documents from Pakistan for the period from 2012-2017, recording whether districts had been classified as "high risk" or "low risk" in each year. Through document review, we developed a decision tree to describe the ranking decisions. Then, integrating data from the World Health Organization and Global Polio Eradication Initiative, we constructed a Bayesian decision network reflecting investments in polio surveillance and immunization campaigns, surveillance metrics, disease incidence, immunization rates, and occurrence of polio cases. We test these factors for statistical association with the outcome of interest-a change in risk rank between the beginning and the end of the one-year time period. We simulate different spending scenarios and predict their impact on district risk ranking in future time periods. We find that per district spending increases are associated with increased identification of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). However, the low specificity of AFP investment and the largely invariant ranking of district risk means that even large increases in surveillance spending are unlikely to promote major changes in risk rankings at the current stage of the Pakistan polio eradication campaign.

AB The global polio eradication initiative (GPEI), which started in 1988, represents the single largest, internationally coordinated public health project to date. Completion remains within reach, with type 2 wild polioviruses apparently eradicated since 1999 and fewer than 2000 annual paralytic poliomyelitis cases of wild types 1 and 3 reported since then. This economic analysis of the GPEI reflects the status of the program as of February 2010, including full consideration of post-eradication policies. For the GPEI intervention, we consider the actual pre-eradication experience to date followed by two distinct potential future post-eradication vaccination policies. We estimate GPEI costs based on actual and projected expenditures and poliomyelitis incidence using reported numbers corrected for underreporting and model projections. For the comparator, which assumes only routine vaccination for polio historically and into the future (i.e., no GPEI), we estimate poliomyelitis incidence using a dynamic infection transmission model and costs based on numbers of vaccinated children. Cost-effectiveness ratios for the GPEI vs. only routine vaccination qualify as highly cost-effective based on standard criteria. We estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI between 1988 and 2035 of approximately 40-50 billion dollars (2008 US dollars; 1988 net present values). Despite the high costs of achieving eradication in low-income countries, low-income countries account for approximately 85% of the total net benefits generated by the GPEI in the base case analysis. The total economic costs saved per prevented paralytic poliomyelitis case drive the incremental net benefits, which become positive even if we estimate the loss in productivity as a result of disability as below the recommended value of one year in average per-capita gross national income per disability-adjusted life year saved. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the finding of positive net benefits of the GPEI remains robust over a wide range of assumptions, and that consideration of the additional net benefits of externalities that occurred during polio campaigns to date, such as the mortality reduction associated with delivery of Vitamin A supplements, significantly increases the net benefits. This study finds a strong economic justification for the GPEI despite the rising costs of the initiative. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine how much people with late effects of polio are bothered by various impairments and their influence on everyday life.
   Design: A mixed-methods design.
   Subjects/patients: Seven women and 7 men (mean age 70 years) with late effects of poli.
   Methods: Self-reported Impairments in Persons with late effects of Polio (SIPP) scale and face-to-face interviews. In SIPP, the participants rated, from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), how much they had been bothered by late effects of polio-related impairments. Qualitative data were analysed using systematic text condensation. Each quotation was deductively analysed based on its conceptual representation regarding perceived influence on everyday life.
   Results: Participants were most bothered by muscle and/or joint pain during physical activity, muscle weakness and general fatigue, which corresponded with the number of interview quotations. The impairments negatively influenced daily life, such as household chores, walking, riding a bicycle and social participation. Increased impairments and reduced functioning on the less-affected side also caused worry and distress.
   Conclusion: Common late effects of polio-related impairments greatly affected participants' activity and participation. By using both the SIPP scale and face-to-face interviews, an increased understanding of how late effects of polio-related impairments influence everyday life was achieved.

AB Many patients with post-poliomyelitis syndrome can benefit from a management program. When a post-polio patient presents with new symptoms, it is first essential to identify and treat other medical and neurological conditions which could produce these symptoms. New weakness can be managed with exercise (stretching, strengthening, and aerobic), avoidance of muscular overuse, weight loss, orthoses, and assistive devices. Fatigue can be managed with energy conservation techniques, lifestyle changes, pacing, regular rest periods or naps during the day, amitriptyline to improve sleep, and possibly pyridostigmine (trial in progress). The management of pain is dependent upon its cause. The treatment of post-polio muscular pain can include activity reduction, pacing (rest periods during activity), moist heat, ice, and stretching, use of assistive devices, and life style modifications. Fibromylagia can be treated with amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and aerobic exercise. Joint and soft tissue abnormalities can be managed with modification of extremity use, physiotherapy, orthoses, assistive devices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and rarely steroid injections and surgery. Superimposed neurological disorders may produce pain, and should be identified and treated. The identification and treatment of pulmonary dysfunction in a post-polio patient is an important aspect of management, and is discussed elsewhere in this issue. Dysphagia can be managed with diet changes, use of special breathing and swallowing techniques, monitoring fatigue and taking larger meals earlier and smaller meals later, and avoiding eating when fatigued. The management of psychosocial difficulties usually requires an interdisciplinary approach, and may include a post-polio support group, social worker, psychologist, and psychiatrist.

ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB The history of polio in Italy is relatively short because the particular social and demographic history of the country has actually compressed the most dramatic history of the polio epidemic into only 40 years, from the first severe epidemic just before World War II to the early 1980s, when the epidemic vanished thanks to an effective and country-wide vaccination campaign. The epidemic, however, had a formidable impact on medicine, public health, social attitudes and culture. An analysis of this case study can illustrate the impact of an epidemic of a severe disease on individual and collective life, and at the same time the efficacy of public health measures against it, and the importance of the social structure, state and private, in coping with the consequences of the epidemics. In this period, the attitude towards the handicapped changed from stigma and isolation to social integration, thanks especially to the changes in health legislation, social action and the initiatives of the patient' associations.

AB Appropriate response to polio outbreaks represents an important prerequisite for achieving and maintaining global polio eradication. We use an existing dynamic disease transmission model to evaluate the impact of different aspects of immunization campaigns in response to polio outbreaks occurring in previously polio-free areas. This analysis yields several important insights about response strategies. We find that delay in response represents a crucial risk factor for occurrence of large outbreaks and we characterize the tradeoffs associated with delaying the initial response to achieve better population coverage. We also demonstrate that controlling most potential outbreaks will likely require at least three immunization rounds, although the impact of the optimal interval between rounds varies. Finally, long after oral poliovirus vaccine cessation the choice of target age groups during a response represents an important consideration.

AB This paper examines the long-term effects of childhood disability on individuals' educational and occupational choices, late-career labor market participation, and mortality. We merge medical records on children hospitalized with poliomyelitis during the 1952 Danish epidemic to census and administrative data, and exploit quasi-random variation in paralysis incidence in this population. While childhood disability increases the likelihood of early retirement and disability pension receipt at age 50, paralytic polio survivors are more likely to obtain a university degree and to go on to work in white-collar and computer-demanding jobs than their non-paralytic counterparts. Our results are consistent with individuals making educational and occupational choices that reflect a shift in the comparative advantage of cognitive versus physical skills. We also find that paralytic polio patients from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more likely to die prematurely than their non-paralytic counterparts, whereas there is no effect on mortality among polio survivors from more advantaged backgrounds.

AB While global polio eradication is most often associated with "philanthrocapitalism," the program has its roots in the Cold War East. This paper shifts the beginnings of polio eradication by three decades and argues that the vaccine developed in the nexus of liberal internationalism and socialist international networks. The result of a collaboration between Albert Sabin, Soviet and Eastern European virologists and public health officials, the live polio vaccine used today in polio eradication programs began its global journey in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Cuba. The paper argues that socialist ideas and practices of health provided fertile ground for a disease elimination program that rested on a combination of primary health structures and top-down initiatives. Taking the case of the Sabin vaccine, it considers the role of political systems in disease eradication.

AB We evaluate the impact of oral polio vaccines on the incidence of all disabilities (locomotor, hearing, visual, speech, and mental) in India, focusing on polio-related disability, which constitutes the largest fraction of locomotor disabilities. Polio was hyperendemic in India even as recently as the early 1990s, but the country was declared wild polio virus-free in 2014. Intent-to-treat effects from difference-in-differences with multiple time period models that condition on demographic and socio-economic characteristics reveal that access to oral polio vaccines in the year of birth reduced the incidence of any disability, locomotor disability, and polio-related disability by 20.5%, 11.6%, and 7.2%, respectively, signaling substantial gains. Impacts on any disability underline that polio vaccines had positive spillover effects on other disability categories as well. The eradication of polio in India, while relatively late, brought significant health benefits and is a notable health economics success story in a developing context.

AB As the world comes closer to the eradication of polio, the question of preparing for life after this debilitating disease becomes increasingly pertinent. This paper focuses on on-going institutional attempts to conceptualise, plan, and deliver a world after polio. Drawing upon interviews with global health officials and ethnographic fieldwork with eradication initiatives in Nigeria and Pakistan, I explore how international donors are transitioning towards life after the disease and the curtailment of the substantial resources it has successfully mobilised. Focusing specifically on the wind-down of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, I critically examine key risks emerging from polio transition and highlight a series of spatial and political assumptions about the emergent post-polio contours of global health that have largely been obscured by attempts to render transition planning as little more than a technical exercise.

AB While there have been many reports of the decline in motor function in patients with prior-polio, there have been few reports of quantitative changes in muscle function and the pathophysiological mechanisms for the deterioration are poorly understood. This paper describes the establishment of a postpolio clinic and the principles adopted in quantitative muscle testing using twitch interpolation. Peripheral endurance and/or voluntary drive to muscles is impaired in about 30 % of prior-polio patients attending the clinic. Progression of these deficits is slow and not easily predicted by factors associated with the original illness.

AB Background: Measles vaccine (MV) administered as the last vaccine after the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) may be associated with better child survival unrelated to prevention of measles infection. Other studies have shown that MV administered after DTP was more beneficial and was associated with lower mortality compared with DTP administered after MV or DTP administered simultaneously with MV. We compared the difference in mortality between measles vaccinated after DTP3 and measles-unvaccinated children in Navrongo, Ghana.
   Methods: This was a follow-up study involving annual cohort of children aged 9-23 months from 1996 to 2012. We assessed survival in relation to the measles vaccination status within the first 12 months from interview date and until 5 years of age using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: In all, 38,333 children were included in the study. The proportion of children vaccinated with MV-after-DTP3 increased from 45% in 1996 to 95% in 2012. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for measles unvaccinated compared with MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated children was 1.38 (1.15-1.66) in the first 12 months after assessment of vaccination status and 1.22 (1.05-1.41) with follow-up to 5 years of age. The national immunization days campaigns with oral polio vaccine or MV might have reduced the effect of being MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated vs MV-unvaccinated. For 12 months of follow-up, the HR before a campaign for MV-unvaccinated children was 1.63 (1.23-2.17) compared to those who received MV-after-DTP3. After the campaign, the HR reduced to 1.23 (0.97-1.54). Stratifying the analysis by sex, measles-unvaccinated boys had a HR of 1.69 (1.33-2.61) compared to measles-unvaccinated girls who had a HR 1.06 (0.79-1.40) during 1-year follow-up. In 1989, only 7% of children in the area had received MV-after-DTP3; the increase in MV-after-DTP3 coverage from 1989 to 2012 may have lowered mortality rate among children aged 9 months to 3 years by 24%.
   Conclusion: Though an observational study, our findings suggest that measles vaccination, administered in the recommended sequence, is associated with improved child survival and may have contributed importantly to the mortality decline toward the achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4.

AB Since 2005, Pakistan has witnessed a net increase in polio, reaching a 15-year crest in 2014 when 306 cases were reported. Pakistan, along with Afghanistan, is one the remaining two polio-endemic countries. The numbers of cases reported in Pakistan in 2014 were far in excess of Afghanistan (28) and Nigeria (6). This paper focuses on the endemic militancy plaguing the country that has recently created grave obstacles for countrywide polio eradication. We argue that the relationship between polio and militancy in Pakistan has had two facets. First, polio vaccination efforts have become a casualty of militancy: over the last decade, polio vaccination was periodically banned in militant strongholds, large cohorts of children remained unvaccinated in remote frontier regions as vaccinators were unable to reach them, and anti-vaccination discourses in many parts of the country deterred others from vaccinating their children. The second relationship between the presence of polio in Pakistan and militancy is one where state-led polio vaccination efforts became a target of militancy. This was through the deliberate killing of polio workers; since July 2012, 71 contractual government employees tasked with administering polio vaccines have been killed, posing impediments to vaccine coverage. This paper concludes that in addition to implementing policies to improve vaccination coverage, endemic militancy must be addressed before polio can be eradicated.

AB Successful global health initiatives are executed on the recognition that globalization involves simultaneous pulls between global unification and fragmentation. This article responds to the need for more understanding of the role of fragmentation in global health initiatives through analyses of 52 northern Nigerian newspaper reports of the 2003-2004 northern Nigerian stoppage of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. By 2009 the stoppage had resulted in an epidemic in Nigeria and polio importations in 20 previously polio-free countries. Findings pointed to beliefs in contemporary forms of Western control and abuse through global organizations (nongovernmental organizations and for-profits), understandings of the "philanthropy" of the West and global organizations as self-serving and malevolent, and doubts about the polio vaccine product.

TI THE HEPATITIS-B IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGN FOR CHILDREN IN THE FEDERATED
   STATES OF MICRONESIA
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Hepatitis B has long been recognized as hyperendemic among persons residing in the western Pacific. Effective control strategies have not been described. From December 1988 through October 1989, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) conducted a campaign to immunize children through age 6 years with three doses of hepatitis B (HB) vaccine. In addition, HB vaccination was incorporated into the routine immunization schedule for all children born in FSM, with the first dose given to newborns. Between December 1988 and October 1989, a total of 64,085 doses of HB vaccine were administered to the children. After the start of the campaign, the subject group was enlarged to include children through 15 years of age in the States of Yap and Kosrae. Fifty-nine percent of the enlarged group in all States received a complete series of HB vaccinations. During each client encounter, individual immunization records were examined and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, oral polio vaccine, and measles-mumps-rubella antigens were administered to children who were not adequately immunized. The annual immunization assessment for 1990 showed coverage improved significantly from Previous years in every FSM State.

AB The effect of live oral polio virus vaccination on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients was examined in a double-blind study. CFS patients were allocated randomly to placebo (N = 7) or vaccine (N = 7) conditions. All control subjects received the vaccine (9). Vaccine administration was not associated with clinical exacerbation of CFS, However, objective responses to the vaccine revealed differences between patients and controls: increased poliovirus isolation, earlier peak proliferative responses, lower T-cell subsets on certain days post vaccination and a trend for reduced gamma-interferon in the CFS-vaccine group. Polio vaccination was not found to be clinically contraindicated in CFS patients, however, there was evidence of altered immune reactivity and virus clearance.

ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB The costs associated with polio research in the late 1920s were high, while sources for research funding remained scarce. This began to change in the early 1930s with the creation of three private philanthropies that would form the basis of a system to fund polio research adequately: the International Committee for the Study of Infantile Paralysis (1928), The President's Birthday Ball Commission (1934), and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (1938). This article explores how these three organizations shaped the process for directing funds to polio research. Beginning with the International Committee, all three philanthropies used medical advisory committees as vehicles for the review of proposals for research. The National Foundation adopted many of the policies and procedures of the earlier organizations, drawing on the experiences, misfortunes, and successes of its predecessors. The National Foundation also relied on some of the same personnel, although the microbiologist and writer Paul de Kruif, who was an influential figure in the early years, was gradually pushed out. This essay explores the establishment of the medical advisory committees of the National Foundation and reveals how by 1941 under leadership of Basil O'Connor and Dr. Thomas Rivers they developed a systematic and readily legitimated process for directing funding. By 1941, the NFIP had in place the fund-raising capacity to underwrite the scientific research that would ultimately produce two successful polio vaccines in the next twenty years.

AB Objectives. We assessed whether extra-immunization can serve as a clinical indicator for fragmentation of care.
   Methods. Using public-use files of the 1999-2003 National Immunization Survey, we classified children 19-35 months of age by their vaccination providers for the degree of fragmentation of care as ordered from lowest with one vaccine provider, to increasing fragmentation with multiple providers in one facility type, to multiple providers in more than one facility type. Extra-immunization was defined conservatively based on the year-specific recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for immunizations due before 18 months of age. Of note, 1999-2003 transitioned from oral to inactivated poliovirus vaccines.
   Results. The rate for extra-immunization was 9.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2, 9.7). Of single vaccines, the rate for polio vaccine was highest (5.7%, 95% CI 5.5, 6.0). Extra-immunization was lowest for the 69% of children with only one vaccination provider (6.4%, 95% CI 6:1, 6.7), was higher in children who had more than one vaccination provider with one vaccination facility type (13.9%, 95% CI 13.2, 14.6), and highest with more than one facility type (24.1%, 95% CI 22.5, 25.6). Logistic regression (including race/ethnicity, language, provider type, survey year, and a parent-held immunization record) confirmed that multiple providers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.30), multiple facility types (AOR=4.67), Spanish language (AOR=1.29), and race/ethnicity (black AOR=1.16, Hispanic AOR=1.31) were each associated with extra-immunization. Excluding poliovirus vaccine from the analysis, AORs for multiple providers and multiple facility types increased to 3.64 and 8.95, respectively.
   Conclusions. Extra-immunization is associated with receiving immunizations from multiple providers and multiple facility types.

AB Eighty former poliomyelitis patients and the sibling nearest in age and of same sex were examined with matched-pair analysis to evaluate the effect of previous poliomyelitis (polio) on social factors and general health. Fifty-four pairs with women (68%), and 26 pairs with men (32%) with a mean age 60.4 years were included. Data were collected by questionnaire. There was no significant difference in length of education between patients and siblings (categories < 8 years, 8-12 years, and > 12 years). Employment rate at age 40 years was 78% for patients and 88% for siblings (full-time or part-time); this difference was not significant. Educational options were considered to have been excellent by 38% of the patients and 26% of the siblings (not significant), with a fair agreement within the pairs (kappa=0.31). There was no significant difference regarding professional options; rated as excellent by 33% of patients, and 28% of siblings, with a fair agreement (kappa=0.25) also for this issue. Perception of general health today expressed on a horizontal VAS-scale (0-10) was significantly lower among the patients than the siblings, mean values of 5.8 and 6.8 (P < 0.001) respectively. Patients also reported a lower quality of life (P=0.03), and less energy for leisure activities (P=0.008). Post polio symptoms like muscular and articular pain, and abnormal tiredness were more common among patients than siblings, whereas there was no difference regarding coexisting illness. In conclusion, polio patients and their siblings reckoned their educational and professional options to have been at the same level. The patients were well educated and employed to the same degree up to the age of 40 years, but now at a higher age reported reduced general health.

TI Reducing resistance to polio immunisation with free health camps and

SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH

ID POLIOMYELITIS; ERADICATION
AB Since 1997, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has sponsored regular door-to-door polio immunisation campaigns in northern Nigeria. On 30 July 2015, the country was finally declared poliofree, a hard won success. At various times, polio eradication has been threatened by rumours and community tensions. For example, in 2003, local Imams, traditional leaders and politicians declared a polio campaign boycott, due to the concerns about the safety of the polio vaccine. Although the campaigns resumed in 2004, many parents continued to refuse vaccination because of the persistence of rumours of vaccine contamination, and anger about the poor state of health services for conditions other than polio. To address this, UNICEF and Nigerian Government partners piloted two interventions: (1) mobile 'health camps' to provide ambulatory care for conditions other than polio and (2) an audiovisual clip about vaccine safety and other health issues, shareable on multimedia mobile phones via Bluetooth pairing. The mobile phone survey found that Bluetooth compatible messages could rapidly spread behavioural health messages in low-literacy communities. The health camps roughly doubled polio vaccine uptake in the urban ward where it was piloted. This suggests that polio eradication would have been accelerated by improving primary health care services.

AB Background. Pockets of undervaccinated individuals continue to raise concerns about their potential to sustain epidemic transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases. Prior importations of live polioviruses (LPVs) into Amish communities in North America led to their recognition as a potential and identifiable linked network of undervaccinated individuals.
   Methods.aEuro integral We developed an individual-based model to explore the potential transmission of a LPV throughout the North American Amish population.
   Results.aEuro integral Our model demonstrates the expected limited impact associated with the historical importations, which occurred in isolated communities during the low season for poliovirus transmission. We show that some conditions could potentially lead to wider circulation of LPVs and cases of paralytic polio in Amish communities if an importation occurred during or after 2013. The impact will depend on the uncertain historical immunity to poliovirus infection among members of the community.
   Conclusions.aEuro integral Heterogeneity in immunization coverage represents a risk factor for potential outbreaks of polio if introduction of a LPV occurs, although overall high population immunity in North America suggests that transmission would remain relatively limited. Efforts to prevent spread between Amish church districts with any feasible measures may offer the best opportunity to contain an outbreak and limit its size.

TI Are we doing enough? Evaluation of the Polio Eradication Initiative in a
   district of Pakistan's Punjab province: a LQAS study
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID IMMUNIZATION DATA QUALITY; VACCINATION COVERAGE; CHILD VACCINATION;
   COLD-CHAIN; FRAMEWORK; PROGRAMS; ACCURACY
AB Background: The success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was remarkable, but four countries Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria - never interrupted polio transmission. Pakistan reportedly achieved all milestones except interrupting virus transmission. The aim of the study was to establish valid and reliable estimate for: routine oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage, logistics management and the quality of monitoring systems in health facilities, NIDs OPV coverage, the quality of NIDs service delivery in static centers and mobile teams, and to ultimately provide scientific evidence for tailoring future interventions.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study using lot quality assessment sampling was conducted in the District Nankana Sahib of Pakistan's Punjab province. Twenty primary health centers and their catchment areas were selected randomly as 'lots'. The study involved the evaluation of 1080 children aged 12-23 months for routine OPV coverage, 20 health centers for logistics management and quality of monitoring systems, 420 households for NIDs OPV coverage, 20 static centers and 20 mobile teams for quality of NIDs service delivery. Study instruments were designed according to WHO guidelines.
   Results: Five out of twenty lots were rejected for unacceptably low routine immunization coverage. The validity of coverage was questionable to extent that all lots were rejected. Among the 54.1% who were able to present immunization cards, only 74.0% had valid immunization. Routine coverage was significantly associated with card availability and socioeconomic factors. The main reasons for routine immunization failure were absence of a vaccinator and unawareness of need for immunization. Health workers (96.9%) were a major source of information. All of the 20 lots were rejected for poor compliance in logistics management and quality of monitoring systems. Mean compliance score and compliance percentage for logistics management were 5.4 +/- 2.0 (scale 0-9) and 59.4% while those for quality of monitoring systems were 3.3 +/- 1.2 (scale 0-6) and 54.2%. The 15 out of 20 lots were rejected for unacceptably low NIDs coverage by finger-mark. All of the 20 lots were rejected for poor NIDs service delivery (mean compliance score = 11.7 +/- 2.1 [scale 0-16]; compliance percentage = 72.8%).
   Conclusion: Low coverage, both routine and during NIDs, and poor quality of logistics management, monitoring systems and NIDs service delivery were highlighted as major constraints in polio eradication and these should be considered in prioritizing future strategies.

AB Introduction: Remunerative employment is a major concern of individuals with chronic disabilities, among them, those with longstanding poliomyelitis (LSP). Although LSP is not rare there are almost no data related to work participation.
   Purpose: The aims of the current study were to determine the effects of a number of social and functional variables as barriers or facilitators to work participation in persons with LSP.
   Patients and methods: Charts of 123 LSP patients of working age that were seen in the post-polio outpatient clinic, between the years 2000 and 2005 were reviewed for the study. Data on age, gender, family status, level of function in activities of daily living, basic, and extended (B-ADL and E-ADL), and mobility were then analyzed for correlation to the vocational status.
   Results: Seventy-two people (58.5%) were employed at the time of the survey. Gender and marital status were not found to significantly differ as regard to employment. Using assistive devices for mobility or being dependent for basic ADL were associated with lower levels of employment. Driving was positively associated with the employment status of the LSP individuals.
   Conclusion: Persons with LSP encounter important barriers to work participation, particularly on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) components of activity and environment.

AB Objective: Follow-up of the health of patients with prior polio over a 17-year period.
   Design: Follow-up study.
   Patients: Patients with prior polio.
   Methods: The study questionnaire was answered in 1995 by 270 patients. In 2012 the questionnaire was sent again to the surviving patients.
   Results: Of the patients who answered the questionnaire in 1995, 116 (40%) were still alive in 2012. The group of patients who had died was older, and had a mean age of 70 years in 1995. A total of 60 patients participated in the study by answering the questionnaire in both 1995 and 2012. Most of these patients (84%) reported that they felt progressively worse, with poor mobility and increased muscle weakness in 2012 compared with 1995, and more than half reported a lower quality of life in 2012. The number of wheelchair users had increased significantly. Furthermore, the patients experienced increasing problems with activities of daily living (ADL) function.
   Conclusion: More than half of the patients with prior polio had died between 1995 and 2012. These patients were, on average, older than patients surviving in 2012. When interviewed in 2012 most of the patients felt progressively worse, with poor mobility and increased muscle weakness.

ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB The 'polio eradication initiative' launched by the World Health Assembly in 1988, although successfully implemented in several countries, could not achieve the goal of global eradication by the year 2000. It has components on strengthening routine immunization system, observance of National Immunization Days (NIDs) and strengthening of surveillance for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). Recently, this strategy was challenged in Kerala, India. Kerala has excellent health indicators compared with other Indian states. In 1999, Intensified Pulse Polio Immunization (IPPI) was introduced with four NIDs throughout India. More than 2000 doctors working under the Kerala Government challenged the strategy, demanding its redesign. Zero prevalence of polio for 2 years, near-complete coverage of children by the routine system, probable business interests of vaccine manufactures and suppliers, dubious interests of officials, and weakening of the routine system by concentrating more on NIDs were all cited as reasons for discontinuing current strategy. The authorities, citing the success stories of polio eradication by the global initiative in several countries, discard the allegations as baseless. They alleged that the medical officers who were on strike demanding higher pay and better conditions were using the 'polio issue' to win their strike. The incidence of two polio cases in Malappuram in northern Kerala during September 2000 has further complicated the issue. As the controversy continues it is felt that the 'eradication initiative' will have to be revisited.

TI Ethical dilemmas in current planning for polio eradication
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB Intensification of polio eradication efforts worldwide raises concerns about costs and benefits for poor countries. A major argument for global funding is the high benefit-cost ratio of eradication; however, financial benefits are greatest for rich countries. By contrast, the greatest costs are borne by poor countries; the Pan American Health Organization has estimated that host countries bore 80% of costs for polio eradication in the Americas. The 1988 World Health Assembly resolution setting up the polio Eradication Initiative carried the proviso that programs should strengthen health infrastructures. Drastic cuts in donor funding for health make this commitment even more important. Two international evaluations have reported both positive and negative effects of polio and Expanded Programme on Immunization programs on the functioning and sustainability of primary health care. Negative effects were greatest in poor countries with many other diseases of public health importance. If poor countries are expected to divert funds from their own urgent priorities, donors should make solid commitments to long-term support for sustainable health development.

TI BODY-IMAGE AND PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS - AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
AB Fifteen paralytic polio patients and 15 controls served as subjects of a study designed to investigate body image in paralytic polio. Three experimental tasks were constructed with the aim of obtaining self assessment in physical and in symbolic terms.- They were designed with the aim of maximizing the projection of body image within a framework suggested by Schilder''s definition of the concept. No differences were found in body image per se. Certain body parts tended to arouse greater concern among polio patients. These were the chest and abdomen, spinal cord, and the hands. General body-image-related-anxiety was characteristic of the polio group. This anxiety was inferred to be a result of conflict engendered by the attempt to retain the pre-onset body image as reference point in the face of the realistic impairment experienced by the patients.

TI Polio monologues: translating ethnographic text into verbatim theatre
SO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE disability; life history; polio; recorded delivery; theatre
ID DOCUMENTARY; IDENTITY; DISABILITY
AB Mass vaccination programmes mean that poliomyelitis is almost a forgotten memory in the Global North. But in reality its effects continue as many people who contracted paralytic polio in childhood may develop functional deterioration (Post-Polio Syndrome or PPS) in later adulthood; mass migration and escape from violence means that it is also re-emerging in contemporary societies. Thus it is crucial for different audiences to have opportunities to engage with, and understand the life histories of polio survivors and their personal experiences of disease and disability across biographical and historical time. This article discusses the process of using recorded delivery verbatim techniques, with disabled and non-disabled actors, to translate ethnographic research about social history of polio into a creative accessible medium for new generation audiences to learn about the hidden, often contested, histories of disability and disease that may collide with professional, medical and public discourse. Our contention is that ethnodrama can give a voice to the voiceless, and enable them to contribute to the production of new knowledge, health interventions and policy instruments that affect their lives.

   There are numbers of persons living in the community with late effects of polio, of which many develop new symptoms, but the course of progression is unclear.
   Objectives -
   To assess changes after 4 years in ability and perceived difficulty in persons with late effects of polio.
   Material and methods -
   Community dwelling persons from a polio clinic. Information was gathered by questionnaire and interview on demographics, age at polio onset, affected body parts, health problems, the use of assistive devices, housing condition and activities of daily living (ADL) function as well as perceived difficulties.
   Results -
   There were no significant increase in frequency of ADL dependency but perceived difficulties increased significantly and more used mobility devices.
   Conclusions -
   Over 4 years, more persons perceived difficulties and the use of assistive devices increased. This is might reflect adaptation and acknowledgement of problems previously ignored. Time is a factor in integrating knowledge and adaptation.

TI Detection and Initial Response to a Type 2 Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus -
   Sichuan Province, China, 2019
SO CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB What is already known about this topic?
   After the type 2 strain of the live, attenuated poliovirus vaccine was withdrawn globally in 2016, any identification of a type 2 poliovirus is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (VDPV2) was identified in Sichuan, prompting an urgent, comprehensive investigation and response.
   What is added by this report?
   Type 2 monovalent, live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV2) is being used to respond to the numerous VDPV2 outbreaks seen around the world. In contrast, the response in Sichuan used Sabin strain inactivated poliovirus (sIPV) to stop circulation of the VDPV2. In the 6 months following the vaccination response, there have been no VDPV2s detected in Sichuan, despite extensive search.
   What are the implications for public health practices?
   Further search for the VDPV2 must continue in order to determine whether transmission has been stopped. The ongoing investigation and response to the Sichuan VDPV2 is providing evidence to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative on managing VDPV2 outbreaks.

TI Polio, public health memories and temporal dissonance of re-emerging
   infectious diseases in the global north
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

ID ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITIES; NEW-YORK; PROPHECY; VACCINE; UK
AB Social science research on polio has been centred in the global south, where countries that remain endemic or vulnerable to outbreaks are located. However, closely-related strains of poliovirus were detected in the sewage systems of several New York State counties and London boroughs in 2022. These detections constituted the first encounters with polio in the United States and United Kingdom for a generation - for both public health agencies and publics alike. This paper takes the transnational spread of poliovirus in 2022 as an opportunity to critique how public health memories of twentieth-century polio epidemics were mobilised to encourage vaccine uptake among groups considered vulnerable to transmission, notably Orthodox Jewish families. The study integrates data collected in London and New York as part of academic engagement with health protection responses to the spread of polio. Methods in both settings involved ethnographic research, and a total of 59 in-depth semistructured interviews with public health professionals, healthcare providers, and Orthodox Jewish community partners and residents. Analysis of results demonstrate that narratives of epidemiological progress were deployed in public health responses in London and New York, often through references to sugar cubes, iron lungs, and timelines that narrate the impact of routine childhood immunisations. While memories of polio were deployed in both settings to provoke an urgency to vaccinate, vulnerable publics instead considered the more recent legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to trust recommendations and responses. Critical attention to memory places analysis on the divergences between institutional (public health agencies) and peopled (publics) responses to disease events. Responses to re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks engender a temporal dissonance when historical narratives are evoked in ways that contrast with the contemporary dilemmas of people and parents.

TI Polio eradication initiative in India: Deconstructing the GPEI
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
ID PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS; OUTBREAK
AB The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) promised eradication of polio by the year 2000 and certification of eradication by 2005. The first deadline is already a matter of history. With the reporting of polio cases in 2004, the new deadline for polio eradication by 2004 is postponed further. This article seeks to argue that the scientific and technical bodies spearheading the GPEI, including the WHO, UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, have formulated a conceptually flawed strategy and that it is not weak political will that is the central obstacle in this final push for global eradication. The validity of the claims of "near success" by the proponents of the GPEI is also examined in detail. By taking India as a case study, the authors examine the achievements of the GPEI in nine years of intense effort since 1995. They conclude that the GPEI is yet another exercise in mismanaging the health priorities and programs in developing countries in the era of globalization.

TI NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB A neuropsychiatric study of 108 hospitalized patients with acute poliomyelitis was made during the Boston epidemic of 1955 Of these, 46 patients were in respirators, 48 had paralytic poliomyelitis not requiring a respirator, and 14 had non-paralytic poliomyelitis. Delirium was observed in 17 patients who were acutely ill with bulbar or bulbospinal poliomyelitis. It was characterized clinically by a varying level of consciousness, pleasurable hallucinatory experiences and frequent illusions and delusions. There was waxing and waning of disorientation and confusion with a shortened attention span. Imaginary experiences were often described by patients as "wakeful" or "vivid dreams." Delirium occurred with the acute toxic phase of illness and lasted an average of 2 weeks followed by complete recovery in those patients who survived. Psychological responses to acute poliomyelitis were studied in an attempt to delineate specific mechanisms involved. Rationalization, denial, and regression were often observed and have been described. The occurrence of anxiety and depression at various stages of the disease is noted and discussed. The role of a psychiatrist as part of a hospital polio team is emphasized (5).

AB Polio vaccine hesitancy remains high in Pakistan due to various socio-political, religious, and economic factors. To address this, the government of Pakistan and its international partners such as UNICEF have devised a multipronged communication strategy to counter resistance to polio vaccine in hard-to-reach areas of the country. In this strategy, mainstream news media has been identified as a key stakeholder, as they have the potential to reach a wide range of population and disseminate easy to understand messages including both visuals and text. However, less scholarly attention has been paid to how mainstream news media in Pakistan frame polio and polio vaccine in their visuals. This study aims to fill this gap. Using visual framing as a theoretical framework, we analyzed 115 images from three selected newspapers published from 2010 to 2022. Our results suggest that the newspapers depicted hard-to-reach areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province which were more affected by polio and highlighted the criminality and securitization of polio vaccine in the country. In addition, female polio healthcare workers, who are instrumental in eradicating the disease, have been given marginal coverage, reflecting the importance of gender sensitivity in the region. Overall, this study contributes to the fields of visual communication, health communication, and international communication, particularly related to the Global South.

AB BACKGROUND: Reduced gait performance is common in persons with late effects of polio. OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of change in gait performance over four years in persons with late effects of polio. METHODS: Gait performance was assessed annually in 51 ambulatory persons (mean age 64 years, SD 6) by the Timed "Up & Go" (TUG), Comfortable and Fast Gait Speed (CGS, FGS), and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was measured with a Biodex dynamometer. Mixed Linear Models were used to analyze changes in gait performance and to identify any predictors of change among the covariates gender, age, body mass index, time with new symptoms, baseline reduction in gait performance and knee muscle strength. RESULTS: There were significant linear effects over time (reduction per year) for three gait performance tests; CGS (0.8%; p < 0.05), FGS (1.7%; p < 0.001), and 6MWT (0.7%; p < 0.05) with significant random effects for all tests. The strongest predictor of a change in gait performance was the individual variations in the knee flexor strength (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The small gradual reduction in gait performance over time in persons with late effects of polio is primarily determined by the individual variations in the knee flexor strength.

AB Background: To promote a healthy and active lifestyle there is a need to increase our knowledge of the level of physical activity (PA) among people with late effects of polio.
   Objectives: To examine PA in people with late effects of polio and to assess the relationship between PA, life satisfaction and various sociodemographic factors.
   Methods: PA was assessed in 81 persons with late effects of polio using the Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and by a pedometer. Life satisfaction was assessed with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11).
   Results: The amount of PA varied considerably but on average the participants were physically active almost 3 h per day, mostly in household activities. The mean value of the pedometer counts was 6212 steps per day (SD = 3208). Sixty-nine percent of the participants rated themselves as satisfied with life as a whole. The sum of PADS was positively and significantly related to the number of steps (r = 0.39, p < 0.001), increasing age (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) and to the level of global satisfaction with life (rho = 0.23, p < 0.05). The number of steps was also positively and significantly associated with level of global satisfaction with life (rho = 0.37, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Despite a progressive physical disability, people with late effects of polio are physically active, but much of the activities are performed as part of their household activities and not as traditional exercise. The relationship between PA, life satisfaction and age further supports the general contention that an active lifestyle is an important factor for perceived well-being among older people.

AB Background: Global efforts to eradicate wild polioviruses (WPVs) continue to face challenges due to uninterrupted endemic WPV transmission in three countries and importation-related outbreaks into previously polio-free countries. We explore the potential role of including older children and adults in supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) to more rapidly increase population immunity and prevent or stop transmission.
   Methods: We use a differential equation-based dynamic poliovirus transmission model to analyze the epidemiological impact and vaccine resource implications of expanding target age groups in SIAs. We explore the use of older age groups in SIAs for three situations: alternative responses to the 2010 outbreak in Tajikistan, retrospective examination of elimination in two high-risk states in northern India, and prospective and retrospective strategies to accelerate elimination in endemic northwestern Nigeria. Our model recognizes the ability of individuals with waned mucosal immunity (i.e., immunity from a historical live poliovirus infection) to become re-infected and contribute to transmission to a limited extent.
   Results: SIAs involving expanded age groups reduce overall caseloads, decrease transmission, and generally lead to a small reduction in the time to achieve WPV elimination. Analysis of preventive expanded age group SIAs in Tajikistan or prior to type-specific surges in incidence in high-risk areas of India and Nigeria showed the greatest potential benefits of expanded age groups. Analysis of expanded age group SIAs in outbreak situations or to accelerate the interruption of endemic transmission showed relatively less benefit, largely due to the circulation of WPV reaching individuals sooner or more effectively than the SIAs. The India and Nigeria results depend strongly on how well SIAs involving expanded age groups reach relatively isolated subpopulations that sustain clusters of susceptible children, which we assume play a key role in persistent endemic WPV transmission in these areas.
   Conclusions: This study suggests the need to carefully consider the epidemiological situation in the context of decisions to use expanded age group SIAs. Subpopulations of susceptible individuals may independently sustain transmission, which will reduce the overall benefits associated with using expanded age group SIAs to increase population immunity to a sufficiently high level to stop transmission and reduce the incidence of paralytic cases.

AB Aim: To describe the childhood experiences of patients with polio from the acute phase of the disease during post-war Finland in the 1950s and 1960s.Design: Qualitative empirical study based on self-reported history of nursing rooted in the past, a history of experiences.Methodology: Interview materials were gathered in the form of themes (45) and written interviews (4) (29 September 2018 to 30 June 2019). Data were analysed by reflexive thematic analysis to highlight hidden and latent experiences. This approach generated the study's main theme, themes and subthemes.Results: The main theme, 'shattered childhood', generated from the study results and was then divided into two themes, both of which were influenced in part by the loss of a familiar childhood, the changed environment, the breakdown of the body and the absence of control. Through their childhood memories, polio survivors described their broken childhoods using the following themes: 'betrayal by their bodies' and 'isolation'. In the narratives, the theme 'betrayal by one's own body' was generated by the following subthemes: 'suddenness of the affliction', 'paralysis' and 'being moved to the hospital'. The 'isolation' theme developed from the subthemes 'isolation from the body and surroundings' and 'emotional and social loneliness'.Conclusion: Polio survivors' experiences during the acute stage of the disease were traumatic and demonstrated children's inferior nursing position in Finland in the 1950s and 1960s.Impact: The study increases our understanding of the history of caring for children and families who were affected and disabled by polio and the importance of their experiences in society and healthcare settings.Patient or Public Contribution: The authors collaborated with the Finnish Polio Association to recruit study participants and plan the study. Patients with polio during childhood underwent interviews, and their experiences formulated the data, which were analysed and the basis of the results.Reporting Method :Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ), a 32-item checklist for interviews and focus groups, have been used as a reporting and checklist tool. All authors have agreed on the final version and the use of the COREQ criteria, relationship with participants, theoretical framework, setting, data collection and data analysis and report.

AB The purpose of this historical inquiry research was to explore (a) the relationship of nursing and foundations focusing on polio from 1930 to 1959; (b) the employment and educational opportunities arising from the polio epidemics for white and black nurses, as well as the obstacles encountered; (c) the role of nursing leaders in the care of the crippled child; and (d) the effects of the resolution of the polio epidemics resulting from the polio vaccine on public attitude and on the philanthropic organizations. Relevant journals, primary and secondary sources, and personal interviews were the methods used for data collection. Because of the extraordinary community support for work related to polio, nurses were able to obtain support from foundations. This support resulted in employment and educational opportunities for bedside nursing, primarily for white nurses. Middle and upper class fear of polio enabled the development of powerful and successful private organizations to supplement the available governmental services. This research illustrates the advances that nursing has made and reminds nurses to develop and maintain strong praxis relationships, alliances with philanthropies, referrals for clients with local organizations, and a strong voice in the planning arena.

AB In this study the life histories of 11 Latinas of Mexican American descent aging with permanent impairment related to childhood-onset paralytic polio were explored. These women, age 45 to 62 years, were interviewed 3 times each. Field notes, audiotaped interviews, life course charts, and demographic data were used to collect data chronicling childhood to present day. In the results we present a thematic representation of the societal and cultural influences on the life course trajectories of these women.

TI Polio Eradication Is Just Over the Horizon: The Challenges of Global
   Resource Mobilization
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION

ID POLIOMYELITIS; LESSONS; HEALTH
AB This study draws lessons from the resource mobilization experiences of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). As the GPEI launched its eradication effort in 1988, it underestimated both the difficulty and the costs of the campaign. Advocacy for resource mobilization came as an afterthought in the late 1990s, when achieving eradication by the target date of 2000 began to look doubtful. The reality of funding shortfalls undercutting eradication leads to the conclusion that advocacy for resource mobilization is as central to operations as are scientific and technical factors.

TI Lock in, the state and vaccine development: Lessons from the history of
   the polio vaccines
SO RESEARCH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE lock in; vaccine development; polio vaccine
ID POLIOMYELITIS; SALK
AB Over the past two decades pharmaceutical industry interest in the development of vaccines against infectious diseases has grown. At the same time various partnerships and mechanisms have been established in order to reconcile the interests of private industry with the needs of public health systems (especially in the developing world). The general assumption is that, lacking resources and competences, the public sector has little or no role to play in vaccine development. Drawing on the concept of 'lock in', and the history of vaccines against poliomyelitis, this paper advances a different set of considerations relevant to the role of the public sector. It was thanks to public sector R&D, driven by technical and public health considerations, not commercial ones, that a vaccine that had been virtually 'locked out' of the world markets was improved, and expertise in its production sustained. This vaccine now plays a crucial role in current attempts at eradicating polio. It is suggested that despite subsequent changes in vaccine technology, their different incentive structure requires acknowledgement in current discussion of the potential contribution of public sector vaccine institutes to vaccine innovation.

AB The long-term management of global disease eradication initiatives involves numerous inherently dynamic processes, health and economic trade-offs, significant uncertainty and variability, rare events with big consequences, complex and interrelated decisions, and a requirement for cooperation among a large number of stakeholders. Over the course of more than 16 years of collaborative modeling efforts to support the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, we developed increasingly complex integrated system dynamics models that combined numerous analytical approaches, including differential equation-based modeling, risk and decision analysis, discrete-event and individual-based simulation, probabilistic uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, health economics and optimization. We discuss the central role of systems thinking and system dynamics in the overall effort and the value of integrating different modeling approaches to appropriately address the trade-offs involved in some of the policy questions. We discuss practical challenges of integrating different analytical tools and we provide our perspective on the future of integrated modeling. Copyright (c) 2018 System Dynamics Society

AB Increasing muscular atrophy and joint instability in the post-polio syndrome (PPS) leads to muscle and joint pain. The aim of this study was to describe how persons with post-polio syndrome (PPS) perceive their pain and how the pain affects their everyday lives. The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI-S) was used together with supplementary questions concerning location and verbal description of the pain. The study group comprised 37 persons with PPS who had had pain for an average of 19 years. Most commonly reported was pain from the joints of the extremities, followed by pain from the lower back. The verbal description suggests that pain is a palpable health problem for this study group. The results of the MPI-S show that women had the most pain and that the younger the parsons are, the more the pain involves negative stress experiences. Activities such as outdoor work, social and other activities away from home involve difficulties, according to the results. The study group could manage their pain, experienced social support, and especially women managed to carry out household chores despite their pain. The MPI-S demonstrates acceptable reliability for this study group.

AB Background: The re-introduction of polio among children aged 12-23 months is likely to occur in Ethiopia due to the low vaccination rates against poliovirus. The study sought to examine the predictors of incomplete vaccination against polio among children aged 12-23 months in Ethiopia. Methods: The data used were obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. Binary and Bayesian logistic regressions were used for the data analysis, with parameters estimated using classical maximum likelihood and the Bayesian estimation method. Results: The results revealed that 43.7% of the children were not fully vaccinated against polio in Ethiopia. Maternal age, educational level, household wealth index, exposure to mass media, place of residence, presence of nearby healthy facility, counseling on vaccination, and place of delivery were significant determinants of incomplete polio vaccination among children aged between 12 and 23 months in Ethiopia. Conclusion: Considerable numbers of children are not fully vaccinated against polio in Ethiopia. Individual and contextual factors significantly contributed to incomplete polio vaccination among children in the country. Therefore, the government and other stakeholders should pay particular attention to maternal education to increase mothers' educational level in all regions and give training and counseling in all urban and rural parts of the country on child vaccination to overcome the problem of children's incomplete polio vaccination and/or vaccination dropout.

AB Falls and fall-related injuries are important issue among polio survivors. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of, and consequences and factors associated with falls among Korean polio survivors. A total of 317 polio survivors participated in this study. All participants completed a questionnaire including fall history, symptoms related to postpolio syndrome and other information through a telephone interview. Among them, 80 participants visited our clinic for additional physical measurements and tests. Of the 317 respondents, 68.5% reported at least one fall in the past year. Of the fallers, 42.5% experienced at least one fall during one month. Most falls occurred during ambulation (76.6%), outside (75.2%) and by slipping down (29.7%). Of fallers, 45% reported any injuries caused by falls, and 23.3% reported fractures specifically. Female sex, old age, low bone mineral density, the presence of symptoms related to post-polio syndrome (PPS), poor balance confidence, short physical performance battery and weak muscle strength of knee extensor were not significantly associated with falls. Only leg-length discrepancy using spine-malleolar distance (SMD) was a significant factor associated with falls among Korean polio survivors. Our findings suggest that malalignment between the paralytic and non-paralytic limb length should be addressed in polio survivors for preventing falls.

AB Pakistan is one of the two countries where polio remains endemic. Among multiple reasons of polio prevalence, false religious beliefs are accounted as major barriers towards polio immunization in Pakistan. Within this context, religious scholars are now engaged in polio immunization campaigns to dismantle the myths and battle the resurgence of polio in Pakistan. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and perceived barriers of Muslim scholars towards polio immunization in Pakistan. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey of Muslim scholars was conducted in Quetta and Peshawar divisions of Pakistan. From October to December 2015, a convenience sample of 770 Muslim scholars was recruited from the local mosques and religious institutions to participate in this study. Knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers were assessed by using self-administered, anonymous and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to express the results with p < 0.05 taken as significant. Three hundred and forty-eight (45.2 %) participants exhibited good knowledge about polio with a mean score of 7.16 +/- 2.12 (based on 14 questions). Knowledge gaps were identified about the transmission (32.6 %) and consequences of poliovirus (39.9 %). Overall, 527 (68.4 %) participants showed positive attitudes towards polio immunization with a mean attitude score of 27.35 +/- 2.68 (based on nine statements). The majority of participants agreed on the need of depoliticizing polio immunization issues (87.1 %), while reservations were noted about their willingness to participate in future polio immunization programs (44.6 %). Security (75.8 %) and vaccine management issues (64 %) were reported by the participants as the major barriers towards polio immunization in Pakistan. The findings showed poor knowledge of Muslim scholars towards polio; however, their attitudes were positive towards polio immunization. More studies are required to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Muslim scholars at the national level to validate the findings of this study.

AB Objective: To evaluate vitality and fatigue in post-polio patients, and the relative contributions of physiological and psychological parameters to the level of vitality.
   Design: Multi-centre study.
   Subjects: One hundred and forty-three patients with post-polio syndrome.
   Methods: Inventories of background, quality of life, fatigue and sleep quality were used. Pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Descriptive statistics and correlations were used for all selected parameters. Hierarchical regression models were constructed to examine predictors of variations in vitality, pain, reduced activity and physical fatigue.
   Results: General fatigue accounted for 68%, of the variation in vitality. Of this, 91%, was accounted for by physiological indicators. After controlling for age, physiological parameters accounted for 56.6%, and 25%, if entered before and after the psychological parameters, respectively. The impact of the psychological parameters decreased after accounting for the physiological parameters. Physical fatigue, age and sleep quality were associated with variation in pain. Body mass index. pain and sleep quality, accounted for differences in reduced activity and physical fatigue.
   Conclusion: Vitality in post-polio patients depends on physiological parameters. Mental fatigue is not a prominent predictor. Subgroups with or without fatigue, independent of age. need further study.

AB Objectives: To examine the contributions of sensorimotor factors to postural control and falling in people with prior polio and to determine whether these contributions differ from those found in normal populations.
   Design: Survey and case-control study.
   Setting: A falls and balance laboratory in Australia.
   Participants: Forty persons with prior polio (age range, 28-71y) and 38 age- and sex-matched control subjects.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Lower-limb muscle strength, sway, vision, lower-limb sensation, reaction time, foot-tapping speed, and falls.
   Results: Compared with the control subjects, the prior polio subjects performed similarly in sensory tests but worse in tests that involved a motor component. Within the prior polio group, lower-limb strength was strongly associated with postural sway on a compliant surface and explained more of the variance in sway than in control subjects. Prior polio subjects who fell multiple times had reduced lower-limb strength, slower reaction time, lower foot-tapping speed, and increased sway compared with those who fell less often. However, the rate of decline in lower-limb strength within the prior polio group did not exceed normal, age-related changes.
   Conclusions: This investigation of prior polio subjects provides an appropriate model for studying muscle weakness as a falls risk factor. Weakness was directly associated with falls, and had an indirect effect mediated through increased sway.

AB After more than 30 years of efforts to eliminate polio, India was certified polio free by WHO in 2014. The final years prior to polio elimination were characterised by concentrated efforts to vaccinate hard-to-reach groups in the state of Uttar Pradesh, including migrant workers, religious minority Muslims and impoverished communities with poor pre-existing social support systems. This article aims to describe the management strategies employed by India to improve the deployment and acceptance of vaccines among hard-to-reach groups in Uttar Pradesh in the final years prior to polio elimination. Three main management principles contributed to polio elimination among the hardest to reach in Uttar Pradesh: bundling of health services, local stakeholder engagement and accountability mechanisms for public health initiatives. In an effort to market the polio campaign as an authentic health-oriented programme, vaccine acceptance was improved by packaging other basic healthcare services such as routine check-ups and essential medications. India also prioritised local stakeholder engagement by using influential community leaders to reach vaccine hesitant groups. Lastly, the accountability mechanisms developed between non-profit organisations and decision-makers in the field ensured accurate reporting and identified deficiencies in healthcare worker training. The lessons learnt from India's polio vaccination programme have important implications for the implementation of future mass vaccination initiatives, particularly when trying to reach vulnerable communities.

AB Purpose: To investigate outdoor mobility of immigrants in Sweden who are living with the late effects of polio. Materials and methods: A total of 145 patients with late effects of polio born outside the Nordic region were identified at an outpatient polio clinic. Of these, 74 completed a questionnaire about their mobility and independence in daily life, self-perceived pain and depression, vocational status, mobility assistive devices/aids, transportation modes and driving. Patient characteristics were based on medical records supplied by physicians. Results: Twice as many patients had lower extremities that were affected by polio than upper extremities. This affected their use of different transport modes and caused mobility and transfer problems. Indeed, 39% needed mobility aids and help from another person to move outdoors. Those who reported dependence for outdoor mobility were more often unemployed and more often depressed. Conclusions: Many respondents reported having difficulties with transport mobility, but a large proportion, 57%, were independent and active drivers. It is important to consider outdoor mobility when planning rehabilitation for patients with late effects of polio and foreign backgrounds. In addition to psychosocial factors, dependence on mobility-related activities can lead to dependency and isolation.

   coverage; South Africa; Vaccine stock-outs
AB Introduction: National population-based immunization coverage surveys provide data for validating official administrative coverage figures. However, these costly and Logistically challenging surveys are conducted infrequently. This hospital-based records review determined coverage of birth-dose vaccines, fully immunized under 1-y-old coverage (FIC) of 12- to 59-mo-old children; and the reasons for missed vaccinations.
   Methods: Rotavirus surveillance in South Africa is based on under-5-y-old children being treated for diarrhoea, and includes photocopying the official vaccination document and collecting data on reasons for missed vaccinations. These data were captured from all 508 records collected from 2011 to 2014, and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis.
   Results: Bacille Calmette Guerin coverage was 99%; oral polio vaccine birth dose (OPV(0)) coverage was 99%. Coverage for 12- to 59-mo-olds ranged from 75% for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine third dose to 99% for OPV(0). Several instances of subsequent doses being recorded without prior doses being received resulted in a FIC of 55%. In total, 207 vaccinations were missed by 88 children. Vaccine stock-outs were responsible for 62% of missed vaccinations.
   Conclusions: Efforts to improve vaccine stock management at facility and district Levels should be implemented, and should include vaccinator training and supervision to eliminate vaccine stock-outs and missed vaccination opportunities.

AB Objectives: Many polio survivors have symptoms that are known risk factors for falls in elderly people. This study aims to determine the: (i) frequency; (ii) consequences; (iii) circumstances; and (iv) factors associated with falls in polio survivors.
   Methods: A survey was conducted among 376 polio survivors. Participants completed a falls history questionnaire and additional information was obtained from their medical files.
   Results: Of the 305 respondents, 74% reported at least one fall in the past year and 60% two or more. Sixteen percent of fallers described a major injury after a fall in the last year and 69% reported fear of falling. One-third of fallers had reduced the amount they walked because of their fear of falling. Most reported falls in a familiar environment (86%), during ambulation (72%) and in the afternoon (50%). Quadriceps weakness of the weakest leg (Medical Research Council (MRC) <= 3), fear of falling and complaints of problems maintaining balance were independently associated with both falls and recurrent falls, while increasing age and medication use were not.
   Conclusion: The high rate of falls and consequences thereof, merit the implementation of fall intervention strategies. To maximize effect, they should be tailor-made and target the fall mechanisms specific to polio survivors.

AB Children who attend free medical clinics in Caracas acquire polio-virus antibodies at an early age and clinical poliomyelitis is relatively rare and endemic in type. Clinic children in Galveston acquire antibodies at a somewhat slower rate but in contrast the Galveston children of university staff members acquire antibodies at a very slow rate. In Galveston poliomyelitis is epidemic in type and seasonal outbreaks of epidemic proportions have occurred in 7 of the last 10 years. In Caracas 85% of cases are in children under 4 years of age while in Galveston 33% of cases occur in this age group. Antibody response to Salk vaccine was good in all 3 population groups and in all age groups, emphasizing the value of the vaccine to those groups who need it most.

ID POSTPOLIO SUBJECTS; CARDIORESPIRATORY RESPONSES; MUSCLE FATIGUE;
   POLIOMYELITIS; SYMPTOMS; SURVIVORS
AB Many post-polio individuals note new musculoskeletal and neuromuscular symptoms. In general, post-polio individuals are found to be weaker than non-postpolio individuals. Muscle weakness appears to play a role in functional limitations in post-polio individuals, especially for such activities as walking and stair climbing. Many post-polio individuals also have deficits in muscular work capacity and strength recovery following activity. Importantly, post-polio individuals are known to have normal perception of local muscle fatigue during activity. The perception of fatigue within the working muscle can be used to modify activity and to assist the individual in the avoidance of excessive local fatigue during exercise and performance of activities of daily living. Recent studies have shown that judicious exercise can improve muscle strength, range of motion, cardiorespiratory fitness, efficiency of ambulation as well as add to the patient's sense of well-being. These benefits appear to occur when activity and exercise are kept within reasonable limits in order to avoid excessive muscular fatigue and/or joint or muscle pain. It is suggested that post-polio patients be instructed to avoid activities that cause increasing muscle or joint pain or excessive fatigue, either during or after their exercise program as the performance of activity at too high a level may lead to overuse/overwork problems. The recent literature indicates that exercise within the constraints of fatigue and pain leads to a number of beneficial physiologic adaptations. Judicious exercise should be viewed as an adjuvant in the overall therapeutic program of the post-polio patient, when the individual has the physiologic capacity to exercise.

AB The purpose of this study is to assess health-related quality of life in polio survivors (PS) compared with that in the general population in Korea. Polio survivors (n = 120) from outpatient clinics at two hospitals, healthy controls (HC, n = 121) and members of the general population with activity limitations (AL, n = 121) recruited through a proportional-allocation, systematic sampling strategy from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were surveyed with self-rated health-related quality of life (Euro QoL five-dimensions). The proportion of participants who reported problems in mobility, usual activity, and symptoms of anxiety/depression were higher in the PS group compared with the HC and AL groups. There was no significant difference in the self-care dimension across the groups. Polio-specific questionnaire, pain, depression, fatigue, Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were assessed in the PS group. Those with post-poliomyelitis syndrome had greater problems in mobility, usual activity, and depression/anxiety. Polio survivors, especially those with more pain and fatigue symptoms, and those who did not have access to medical services had poorer health-related quality of life. These findings afford useful information for potential intervention improving quality of life in polio survivors.

DE Syrian; refugee; vaccination status; Turkey
AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to gather information on demographic and health indicators, primarily vaccination status, of Syrians under temporary protection in five provinces of Turkey and to develop infrastructure for vaccination planning.
   Methods: The population under study consists of 89,986 Syrian children, 0-4 years of age, residing in Ankara, Mersin, Gaziantep, Izmir, and Bursa. Initially, we planned to evaluate 2,339 children, although a total of 2,827 children were evaluated by the end of the study.
   Results: Of these children, 74% were born in Turkey, while 20% were born in Syria. In addition, 22.4% (n=634) of the children were never vaccinated, and of these, 67.0% (n = 425) were born in Turkey. In other words, one in five Syrian children born in Turkey (20.3%) had never been vaccinated. Of the Syrian children under temporary protection, the missing vaccinations were as follows: hepatitis B (54.7%); Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (62.5%); five-component combined vaccine (64.6%); conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (58.0%); oral polio vaccine (70.8%); measles, mumps, and rubella (76.6%); varicella (66.8%); and hepatitis A vaccine (76.0%).
   Conclusion: It is important to increase the immunization rates of Syrian children under temporary protection and establish regular vaccination procedures.

AB Recent research showed that exposure to the vaccine against polio in early life had no long-term economic benefits among native Swedes. However, whether this result holds for individuals from other countries remains unexplored. This study explores the relationship between exposure to the vaccine and later-life outcomes, but focuses on individuals who migrated to Sweden (birth cohorts 1946-1971), and constitute a diverse sample in terms of national origin. Using a differences-in-differences approach and register data from the Swedish Longitudinal Immigrant Database, this study explores if being exposed to the vaccine against polio in the year of birth in the country of origin has any impact on adult income, educational achievement, or days or number of hospitalizations. The results are in line with the previous research in showing that there are no statistically significant effects on adult income, education, or health from exposure to the vaccine against polio, regardless of national origin. Furthermore, no scarring effects of exposure to polio epidemics were found on any of the outcomes, reinforcing the hypothesis that polio did not scar individuals in the same way as other contemporary epidemic diseases did, and that the lack of scarring could explain the absence of long-term impact from vaccine exposure.

AB Decision analytic modeling of polio risk management policies after eradication may help inform decisionmakers about the quantitative tradeoffs implied by various options. Given the significant dynamic complexity and uncertainty involving posteradication decisions, this article aims to clarify the structure of a decision analytic model developed to help characterize the risks, costs, and benefits of various options for polio risk management after eradication of wild polioviruses and analyze the implications of different sources of uncertainty. We provide an influence diagram of the model with a description of each component, explore the impact of different assumptions about model inputs, and present probability distributions of model outputs. The results show that choices made about surveillance, response, and containment for different income groups and immunization policies play a major role in the expected final costs and polio cases. While the overall policy implications of the model remain robust to the variations of assumptions and input uncertainty we considered, the analyses suggest the need for policymakers to carefully consider tradeoffs and for further studies to address the most important knowledge gaps.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine if falls in polio survivors, with or without post-polio syndrome (PPS), are related to number of medications taken, use of anti-depressant or psychoactive medications, or self-report of depression. A survey was sent to 300 members of a regional polio support group, asking them to document their fall history, medications used, and the presence of depression. Depression was measured by self-report and with the Geriatric Depression Scale, short form (GDS-15). One hundred and seventy-two usable surveys were returned with 146 of those completing the medication list. Sixty-two percent reported at least one fall in the past year. The multiple logistic regression was significant (p = 0.023), and it indicated depression to be a significant predictor (p = 0.012) of falls in polio survivors with and without PPS. The number of total medications or anti-depressant or psychoactive medications used was not related to fall incidence. Routine screening and treatment for depression may be one aspect of fall prevention which can be implemented through primary care.

AB Objective: To compare plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I, also termed somatomedin C) in polio survivors and healthy control subjects and to determine their relation to selected clinical characteristics.
   Design: Cross sectional study.
   Setting: Polio survivors living in the community recruited from the Wisconsin Polio Support Group.
   Participants: A total of 124 polio survivors (49 males and 75 females), ages 35 to 77 years, and 261 healthy control subjects (139 males and 122 females) of similar age.
   Measurements: Plasma IGF-I levels were compared in polio survivors and age-matched control subjects. In the polio survivor group, the relation of IGF-I to selected clinical characteristics was examined before and after adjusting for covariates.
   Results: Statistical analyses showed that the IGF-I concentrations were significantly lower in the polio survivors than in the controls. This difference was reflected in the means and standard errors of the two groups (0.45 +/- 0.02 vs 0.60 +/- 0.02 units/mL, P < 0.01), Plasma IGF-I below 0.35 units/mL in adults indicates little or no growth hormone secretion. In polio survivors, 38% of the plasma IGF-I values were <0.35 units/mL compared with 19% in the healthy group. Univariate analysis showed that IGF-I in the polio survivors was significantly correlated with age, gender, and body mass index, and with dependency, pain, and difficulty in the activities of daily living (ADLs). The correlations with ADL dysfunction were independent of the correlations with age, gender, and body mass index. IGF-I level did not correlate with the subjective report of recent decline in functional status.
   Conclusion: Lower levels of IGF-I are seen in polio survivors, and this finding correlates with ADL dysfunction. The hyposomatomedinemic tendency of polio survivors may have an adverse effect on their neuromuscular function and quality of life.

AB To investigate the health-related quality of life (QOL) in Swedish patients with post-polio syndrome (PPS), with a focus on sex and age. A total of 364 patients were recruited from five Swedish post-polio clinics. Analysis was carried out using SF-36 and data were compared with those of a normal population. QOL was significantly lower in PPS patients for all eight subdomains and the two main scores (physical compound score and mental compound score) when compared with the controls. Male patients had a significantly higher QOL than female patients for all subdomains and also for mental compound score and physical compound score, a phenomenon also observed in the normal population. There was a decrease in QOL in the physical domains and an increase in vitality with age. PPS decreases health-related QOL in both sexes, more in female patients. QOL for physical domains decreases whereas vitality increases with age in both sexes. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

ID AUTOANTIBODIES; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERN
AB Background: Anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune condition characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms, including epileptic seizures, movement disorders, autonomic instability, disturbances of consciousness, paranoia, delusions, and catatonia. Ovarian teratomas and viral infections, typically Herpes simplex viruses, have previously been demonstrated to precipitate anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but in many cases, the trigger remains unclear. The detection of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in combination with other CSF, electroencephalography (EEG), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, typically leads to diagnostic clarification. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 22-year-old female patient who developed an acute polymorphic psychotic episode 3 days after receiving a booster vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and polio (Tdap-IPV). Her psychiatric symptoms were initially diagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder. Her MRI, EEG, and CSF results were non-specific. Anti-NMDA receptor IgG antibodies against the GluN1 subunit were detected in her serum (with a maximum titer of 1:320), but not in her CSF. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed pronounced relative hypermetabolism of her association cortices and a relative hypometabolism of the primary cortices, on the basis of which an anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis diagnosis was made, and treatment with a steroid pulse was initiated. The treatment led to fast and convincing clinical improvement with normalization of neuropsychological findings, considerable improvement of FDG-PET findings, and decreasing antibody titers. Conclusion: The patient's psychiatric symptoms were most likely caused by anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Her polymorphic psychotic symptoms first occurred after she had received a Tdap-IPV booster vaccination. Although the vaccination cannot have caused the initial antibody formation since IgG serum antibodies were detected only 3 days after administration of the vaccine, the vaccine may have exerted immunomodulatory effects. MRI, EEG, and CSF findings were non-specific; however, FDG-PET identified brain involvement consistent with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This case shows the importance of implementing a multimodal diagnostic work-up in similar situations. The negative CSF antibody finding furthermore fits to the hypothesis that the brain may act as an immunoprecipitator for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies.

DT Article
AB This paper is an analysis of the discursive formation of poliomyelitis in India. The period under consideration is from 1970, prior to the adoption of World Health Organisation's Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) by the government of India, to the first National Pulse Polio Immunisation Campaign held during 1995-96 The change in slate policy from management and control of the disease to its eradication is an outcome of the interaction between local and global factors in international health. The interface between the Indian state and the medical profession foregrounds the discussion in the present paper Indian researchers have questioned the OPV immunisation regime promoted by the global EPI: A survey of Indian paediatric literature reveals that concerns with vaccination efficacy and the immunisation schedule are accorded prime importance in the medical research on poliomyelitis: The review of the medical literature shows how studies on country-specific pathogenesis of vaccine preventable diseases result in recommendations for alternative vaccine regimes that contest the universal norms put forward by the global EPI.

AB Purpose To assess and compare the HRQoL and physical fitness of polio survivors with healthy individuals. Methods Thirty-seven polio survivors and 40 healthy individuals were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was used to evaluate participant's level of fatigue; Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used for evaluating HRQoL, and hand-grip strength, lumbar trunk muscle endurance, flexibility, balance, and aerobic endurance were used as measures for physical fitness. Results Polio survivors had lower HRQoL in most of the dimensions of the SF-36, and they showed a lower level of physical fitness than controls. In particular, mobility-related variables were 20-40% lower in people with PP. Conclusions Subjects with PP had lower scores for the physical component of the HRQoL questionnaire, reduced physical fitness, increased fatigue, less mobility, and a higher fall risk than controls. The outcomes of the study can be useful to the design of future programs tailored specifically to improve the assessment of the physical fitness of subjects with paralytic polio and to facilitate interventions based on appropriate physical exercise regimens.

TI BODY-IMAGE BOUNDARIES AND ADJUSTMENT TO POLIOMYELITIS
SO JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In a group of 56 polio patients, a relationship between psychological adjustment to physical handicap and a measure of body-image boundaries was shown to exist. "Apparently, individuals who conceive of their body boundaries as possessing defensive, armoring, barrier-like qualities are significantly better able to adapt to the circumstances surrounding physical loss than are those individuals whose body concept does not contain these features.".

TI Poor prenatal care does not predict well child care for children born to

AB Objectives: Among mothers receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) and their children, (1) assess characteristics associated with adequate prenatal care and well-child care, and (2) determine if prenatal care predicts well-child care and up-to-date immunizations (UTDI). Methods: This is a retrospective study of mothers with OUD and their children, maternal sociodemographic and health characteristics, and child health characteristics. Adequate prenatal care was defined by the Kotelchuck Index, well-child care by AAP recommendations, and UTDI by the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series. Results: For the 138 mother-child dyads, mothers were largely young (mean: 29 years), multiparous (73%), and receiving Medicaid (93%); only 31% had adequate prenatal care. The majority of children (67%) had adequate well-child care, and UTDI (93%). Children born to non-Hispanic mothers or with LOS > 5 days were more likely to have adequate well-child care, in contrast to those with wheezing who were less likely. In the adjusted analysis, younger children and those born to primiparous mothers were more likely to have adequate well-child care. Adequate prenatal care did not predict adequate well-child care or UTDI. Conclusions: Despite the fact that mothers receiving MAT for OUD often lacked adequate prenatal care, their children had adequate well-child care and UTDI.

TI COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR REDUCING FATIGUE IN POST-POLIO

AB Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy does not reduce fatigue in post-polio syndrome, but is effective in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. This difference in efficacy might be explained by a different role of cognitions in these conditions.
   Objective: To compare fatigue-related cognitions between patients with post-polio syndrome and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. Subjects: Patients with post-polio syndrome (n = 21) and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (n = 24) allocated to a cognitive behavioural therapy intervention in 2 identical trials.
   Methods: Assessed cognitions included: sense of control over fatigue; catastrophizing; acceptance; focusing on fatigue; and perceived social support. Group differences in cognitions (independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests) and group differences in the association of cognitions with fatigue (linear regression models) were studied.
   Results: No differences in cognitions were found between the 2 groups (p > 0.18). Furthermore, there were no cognition-by-group interaction effects, except for "perceived social support", for which a different association with fatigue was found between the 2 groups (p = 0.01). However, univariate models revealed no associations per group.
   Conclusion: Fatigue-related cognitions in severely fatigued patients with post-polio syndrome are not clearly different from those in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. Thus, the lack of efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy in post-polio syndrome cannot be attributed to unique cognitive characteristics of this population.

AB This qualitative study investigated the lifetime illness experience of individuals with the 'late effects' of polio or post-polio syndrome, Fifteen individuals were interviewed twice about their illness experience and the interviews were transcribed verbatim. The empirical material first underwent a categorization process. The preliminary categories generated through this analysis were then condensed into broader categories which in the final analysis gave rise, to the following temporal pattern or stages of the illness experience: (1) the acute phase of polio and subsequent treatment and care; (2) rehabilitation and care at institutions for the disabled; (3) adaptation to a new life; (4) living with the post-polio syndrome today, and finally, (5) memories of the past and apprehensions concerning the future. In spite of the difficult experiences of falling ill and slowly recovering from a life-threatening disease, these individuals have had a good life and accomplished most of their ambitions in the areas of work and family life. Their present psychosocial situation is complicated by the symptoms of the post-polio syndrome which make them more vulnerable to stress, but they are able to handle this burden except when any added strain makes it overwhelming. This potential vulnerability may sometimes express itself as a: sudden flashback to traumatic polio experiences and it is therefore important that nurses are aware of the illness history of this patient group.

DT Article

AB Environmental historians have yet to engage with the history of polio. This article uses a 1949 outbreak that occurred during the global height of polio epidemics but in an unexpected place, Chesterfield Inlet in the Canadian Arctic, to examine the influence of Arctic environments on midcentury biomedical research into poliomyelitis. This influence arose in part because of the historical role of such environments and their indigenous inhabitants as laboratories and research subjects, respectively. This influence also reflected the ongoing importance of environmental etiologies to the study of polio, specifically through the significance of epidemiological and immunological research. The article explores the role of environment in the transmission and perception of the disease in Chesterfield Inlet, as well as the research into climate, food, and immunity that arose out of the epidemic. The Chesterfield Inlet outbreak reveals the significance of the historical colonization of Arctic peoples and environments in shaping the course of the epidemic and the medical knowledge that was created in response to it. The outbreak also demonstrates the ecological perspective shaping an understanding of immunity to polioviruses and encouraging the development of a vaccine.

AB This study describes the meaning of pain and its implications for everyday lifein 35 persons with symptoms of post-polio syndrome. The mean age of the study group is 65 years and the sex ratio of men to women is 1.5:1. The study persons were interviewed on two occasions in their homes and answered a pain questionnaire. The result shows that everyday vocabulary is used to express pain experiences. The study persons normally answered that it hurt, although the interviewers used pain in their questions. The results show that the lower back is the most common location of pain. Joint pains are most common in the upper extremities. The pain is worst in the evening and at night, and tangibly affects the daily rhythm. Physical strain and climatic factors commonly provoke pain, whereas rest and heat give relief. The study show that interviews and pain questionnaire should be supplemented with questions on activities so as to gain a comprehensive view of the difficulties experienced in everyday life.

AB Objective: To describe menopause characteristics of women with physical disabilities from poliomyelitis.
   Methods: Nine hundred and nine women with a history of poliomyelitis completed a survey on health, physical functioning, emotional well being and menopause.
   Results: The majority of the sample was postmenopausal having had a natural menopause around the average age of 50.3 years; 34.7% of the sample had had hysterectomies. Thirty-nine percent were using some form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Menopause symptoms were clustered into psychological, somatic-sensory, somatic-sleep and vasomotor factors. Among never and past HRT users, there were significant differences in menopause factor severity by menopause status. Somatic/sleep symptoms were lowest in never users; past users had significantly higher vasomotor symptoms; desire for sexual activity and painful intercourse did not vary by HRT use. Compared to population estimates, post-polio women had similar rates of hysterectomies overall, but among some age cohorts they had significantly lower rates, contrary to expectations. However, they used HRT at significantly higher rates than expected.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that basic menopause characteristics of women with polio are generally similar to those of their non-disabled peers. There were few substantial differences in severity of menopause symptoms by HRT use, which is critical in light of the dearth of studies examining its risk-benefit ratio among women with physical disabilities. Until such studies provide some evidence of the specific risks or benefits to women with physical disability, each woman should carefully weigh the known risks and benefits with her physician.

AB Karachi is the only mega city in the world with persistent poliovirus transmission. We determined routine childhood immunization rates in Karachi and identified predictors of vaccine completion. A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Karachi between August and September 2008. Data on demographics, socioeconomic, and DTP3 vaccination status in children 12 to 23 months old were collected. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of vaccination completion. Overall, 1401 participants were approached; 1391 consented to participate. Of these, 1038 (75%) were completely vaccinated. Punjabi families had the highest DTP3 coverage (82%), followed by Urdu-speaking families (79%). Pashtun (67%) and Bengali (48%) families had the lowest vaccine coverage. Children of mothers with 12 years of schooling (OR = 25.4; 95% CI = 5.7-113.1) were most likely to be vaccinated. A quarter of study participants were unvaccinated. Targeted strategies for boosting DTP3 rates in communities with low immunization coverage are essential for polio eradication in Karachi.

AB This paper adopts a socio-historical perspective to explore when, how and why the eradication of poliomyelitis has become politicised to the extent that health workers and security personnel are targeted in drive-by shootings. Discussions of the polio crisis in Afghanistan and Pakistan have tended to focus on Taliban suspicions of a US-led public health intervention and the denunciation of 'modernity' by Islamic 'extremists'. In contrast, this paper considers a broader history of indigenous hostility and resistance to colonial immunisation on the subcontinent, suggesting how interconnected public health and political crises today have reactivated the past and created a continuity between events. The paper explores how the biomedical threat posed by polio has become intertwined with military and governmental discourses premised on the 'preemptive strike'. Here, the paper tracks the connections between biological immunity and a postcolonial politics that posits an immunological rationale for politico-military interventions. The paper concludes by reflecting on the consequences for global public health of this entanglement of infectious disease with terror.

AB Maintaining regular physical activity (PA) can be challenging for persons with late effects of polio. This qualitative study of ambulatory persons with late effects of polio explored their perceptions of PA, as well as facilitators of and barriers to PA. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 persons and analyzed with content analysis using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a framework. The participants described positive perceptions of PA and its health benefits. PA was used to prevent further decline in functioning, and the type and frequency of activities had changed over time. Past experiences and personal characteristics impacted PA. Support from close relatives, knowledgeable health care professionals, mobility devices, and accessible environments facilitated PA, whereas impairments, inaccessible environments, and cold weather were the main barriers. To perform PA regularly, persons with late effects of polio may benefit from individualized advice based on their disability and personal and environmental factors.

AB Postpolio syndrome (PPS) is generally defined as a clinical syndrome of new weakness, fatigue, and pain in individuals who have previously recovered from acute paralytic poliomyelitis. These new problems may lead to loss of employment as well as new deficits in instrumental activities in daily living (cleaning, washing, shopping, transportation, etc.), walking, climbing stairs, and personal assistance. We presented three cases of PPS with working disabilities in Japan, and stated the issues confronted with. Particularly at the workplace, PPS individuals need special supports from both rehabilitation medicine and occupational health services, including improved nutrition, achieving ideal body weight, regular and sensible exercise, frequent checkups, and modifying working conditions.

TI Polio, DDT, and Disease Risk in the United States after WorldWar II
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS; HEALTH
AB Between the end of World War II and the early 1950s, researchers, municipal officials, and individuals from Georgia to California employed DDT to stop polio by killing flies, a suspected but debated actor in the disease's transmission. Despite the prominent place of both polio and DDT in postwar US history, this episode has received scant attention from historians. This essay argues that this littleexamined moment captures the tensions between shifting epidemiological concerns and etiological paradigms at midcentury and offers an additional explanation for a risky pesticide's cultural acceptance. In the context of the certain risk of polio, DDT's health and environmental risks-well publicized and publicly discussed after the war-receded as its public health promise expanded. The use of DDT in anti-polio efforts and the arguments against it reflected competition between public health approaches based on sanitation and bacteriology, as well as differing conceptions of the environment's role in human disease. The pesticide was deployed against polio for the better part of a decade despite negative scientific findings concerning its effectiveness. This decision to act on expectation over experimental evidence, this essay argues, reflected the fact that DDT was a war-born "brand" that benefited from ingrained germ consciousness, a boom in consumer culture and advertising, and scientific uncertainty about polio, all of which created a context in which the availability of DDT enabled it to shape research and interventions focused on the disease.

AB Objective To assess the effect of providing BCG and oral polio vaccine (OPV) at an early home visit after delivery.Design Cluster-randomised trial, randomising 92 geographically defined clusters 1:1 to intervention/control arms.Setting Bandim Health Project Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Guinea-Bissau.Participants 2226 newborns enrolled between July 2016 and August 2019.Interventions In both arms, newborns received a home visit within 72 hours after birth. In intervention clusters (n=46), BCG and OPV were provided at the home visit.Main outcome measure Rates of non-accidental mortality were compared in Cox proportional hazards models from (last of) day 1 or enrolment, until (first of) day 60 or registration of non-trial vaccines.Results A total of 35 deaths (intervention: 7, control: 28) were registered during the trial. Providing BCG and OPV reduced non-accidental early infant mortality by 59% (8-82%). The intervention also reduced non-accidental hospital admissions. The intervention had little impact on growth and BCG scarring and tended to increase the risk of consultations.Conclusions The trial was stopped early due to lower-than-expected enrolment and event rates when 33% of the planned number of newborns had been enrolled. Despite the small size of the trial, the results support that early BCG and OPV vaccinations are beneficial and reduce early child mortality and morbidity.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT02504203).

AB Introduction The term 'post-polio syndrome' (PPS) is used to describe new and late manifestations of poliomyelitis that occur later in life. Research in this area has focused upon health status rather than its effect on quality of life.
   Aim To gain an in-depth understanding of the meaning of quality of life for polio survivors and to determine the type of strategies that are used by people with PPS and the support that they consider as important to facilitate participation in everyday life activities that have an impact on their quality of life.
   Method Six focus groups were conducted with 51 participants from two regions in England. Data were audio-taped and analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results Our research found that polio survivors used terms used to describe quality of life which could be associated with that of happiness. Our research has identified resolvable factors that influence quality of life namely inaccessible environments, attitudes of health-care professionals and societal attitudes. Polio survivors have tried alternative therapies, chiefly acupuncture and massage, and found them to be effective in enhancing their quality of life.
   Conclusion It is suggested that health-care professionals should consider factors which influence happiness and implement a person-centred approach with the views of the polio survivor being listened to. The three factors that influenced quality of life could be resolved by health-care professionals and by society. With regard to strategies used, we suggest that polio survivors should have access to the treatments that they perceive as important, although further research is required to design optimal interventions for this client group.

AB Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate disability and quality of life in individuals with the characteristic symptoms of postpolio syndrome.
   Method: Disability is assessed by means of the self-report activities of daily living instrument, and quality of life by means of Kaasa`s questionnaire and the quality of life profile.
   Results: The 39 subjects have on average lived with polio sequelae for 52 years. Their main difficulties are with moving, lifting and carrying. This means restricted mobility, sedentary activities and a need to prioritize. Half of them feel that polio has lessened their possibilities in life, and a quarter have still not accepted the limitations polio has involved. Nevertheless the majority report a high level of psychosocial well-being, and almost a quarter say that living with polio has meant personal development and strength. We found a significant correlation between on the one hand disability with regard to ambulation,;Inn strength and finger strength on the self-report ADL, and on the other hand the number of negative problems on the quality of life profile (0.33-0.45).
   Conclusion : The latter instrument needs further testing before its validity can be determined with certainty.

AB In 1946, Morton Seidenfeld was appointed director of psychological services for the National Federation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP). He believed that once polio's acute phase ended, 75% to 90% of a patient's needs had a psychological component that should be addressed by making psychological services an integral part of the care provided.1 Despite his advocacy (seen as newsworthy enough to be reported by The New York Times2), his vision never was realized. Few polio rehabilitation programs included mental health professionals. The vast majority of those that included mental health facets provided only the most cursory services. Seidenfeld's 1952 survey of the polio literature showed that less than 2% focused on psychological needs.1 Based on the negative memories of interactions with mental health professionals re

AB Background: The circulation of wild poliovirus is expected to cease soon due to the success of the global polio eradication initiative. Thereafter, intensified polio eradication efforts such as National Immunisation Days (NIDs) will most likely be discontinued. As a consequence, the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) will no longer enjoy extra inputs from the polio eradication initiative. We investigated whether today's EPIs are ensuring universal and equitable vaccine coverage; and whether the removal of extra inputs associated with the implementation of NIDs is likely to affect EPI coverage and equity. Methods: Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 15 countries of South Asia and Africa during 1990-2001, we examined absolute levels of EPI coverage; changes in EPI coverage after the introduction of NIDs; and relative coverage according to urban versus rural residence, higher versus lower education of mothers, and wealthiest vs. poorest population segment. Results: Polio and non-polio antigen coverage increased in seven countries during the study period. Substantial inequalities in coverage of non-polio antigens persist, however, translating into inequities in the risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. In some African countries, routine EPI coverage and/or equity declined during the study period. In these countries, any positive effect of NIDs on the EPI coverage must have been small, relative to the negative effects of declining economies or deteriorating health systems. In Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Malawi, even polio coverage declined, in spite of the introduction of NIDs. Conclusion: As additional inputs associated with polio eradication will cease, routine EPI services need to be strengthened substantially in order to maintain levels of population immunity against polio and to improve social equity in the coverage of non-polio EPI antigens. Our findings imply that this aim will require additional inputs, particularly in African countries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Timely diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis is very crucial in developing countries like Pakistan, because this will have significant impact on management. Aim: To assess the surveillance, aetiology and epidemiology of acute flaccid paralysis in a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted at the Paediatric Department of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, in 2022. Data on all children aged 1 month to 15 years and diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis were retrieved from the electronic medical records and patient files of the hospital. The data were analysed using SPSS version 27. Results: Eighty-eight (1.34%) of the 6544 patients admitted to the paediatric ward met the inclusion criteria for acute flaccid paralysis; 63 (71.6%) of them were male, 25 (28.4%) female, mean age 6.68 +/- 3.86 (mean +/- SD) years. Guillain Barre Syndrome was diagnosed in 36 (40.9%) of them, meningoencephalitis in 26 (29.5%), septic arthritis in 6 (6.8%), and hypokalaemia paralysis and cerebrovascular accidents in 5 (5.7%). Three (3.4%) of the patients had post-diphtheria neuropathy and 1 (1.1%) had poliomyelitis. In-hospital mortality was 2.3% (2). Conclusion: Although acute flaccid paralysis is vaccine-preventable and its infectious aetiology is low, its surveillance in Pakistan should be continued to reduce occurrence and progress towards polio eradication.

AB Objective: To describe and enhance our understanding of how persons with late effects of polio experience the influence of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. Participants: Twelve persons with clinically verified late effects of polio who had participated in an individualized, goal-oriented, comprehensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme.
   Methods: Qualitative research interviews analysed using the constant comparative method of grounded theory.
   Results: The rehabilitation programme was experienced as a turning point in the participants' lives. Before rehabilitation they felt they were on a downward slope without control. Rehabilitation was the start of a process of change whereby they acquired new skills, which, over time, contributed to a different but good life. After approximately a year, they had a sense of control and had accepted life with late effects of polio. They had also established new habits, taken on a changed valued self and could look to the future with confidence.
   Conclusion: This qualitative study has shown that persons with late effects of polio can benefit from an individualized, goal-oriented, comprehensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme and experience positive changes in their management of daily activities and in their view of their late effects of polio, their future and their self.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate children with chronic disorders like hemophilia and poliomyelitis from the psychological perspective, to determine the frequency of depression, to identify the risk factors and to investigate the relation between disability and depression. Thirty-five patients with disability due to poliomyelitis and 12 patients with hemophilic arthropathy were included in the study. Thirty-six healthy children from the district schools served as controls. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) was used to assess the extent of depression. For the hemophilia group, joint scores proposed by the World Federation of Hemophilia were used to assess the degree of joint involvement. The pliomyelitis group was evaluated according to the level of ambulation and the need for orthoses. The CDI score was 10.57 +/- 5.87 in the poliomyelitis group, 11.00 +/- 5.64 in the hemophilic arthropathy group and 8.39 +/- 3.78 in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Four of 35 patients with poliomyelitis (11.4%) and two of 12 hemophilic arthropathy patients (16%) exhibitea depression. None of the children in the control group had depression. Since depression interferes with both medical compliance and rehabilitation potential, early diagnosis and treatment is important. Therefore, evaluation of the psychological status of chronically ill children must be a part of the rehabilitation program.

AB This essay argues that the racialized geopolitics of the rhesus monkey trade conditioned the trajectory of tissue culture in polio research. Rhesus monkeys from north India were important experimental organisms in the American "war against polio" between the 1930s and 1950s. During this period, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) expended considerable effort to secure the nonhuman primate for researchers' changing experimental agendas. The NFIP drew on transnational networks to export hundreds of thousands of rhesus monkeys from colonial and later postcolonial India amid the geopolitical upheavals of World War II, the 1947 Partition, and the Cold War. In this essay, I trace how NFIP officials' anxieties about the geopolitics of the monkey trade configured research imperatives in the war against polio. I show how their anxieties more specifically shaped investment in tissue culture techniques as a possible means of obviating dependence on the market in monkeys. I do so by offering a genealogy of the contingent convergence between the use of rhesus monkeys and HeLa cell cultures in the 1954 Salk vaccine trial evaluation. Through this genealogy, I emphasize the geopolitical dimensions of the search for the "right" experimental organisms, tissues, and cells for the "job" of scientific research. The technical transformation of polio research, I argue, relied on the convergence of disparate, racialized biomedical economies.

TI Assessing vaccine introduction and uptake timelines in Gavi-supported
   countries: are introduction timelines accelerating across vaccine
   delivery platforms?

AB Background Previous studies identified factors influencing regulatory approval to introduction timelines for individual vaccines. However, introduction and uptake timelines have not been comprehensively assessed across the portfolio of Gavi-supported vaccines. Methods We analysed median times between introduction milestones from vaccine licensure to country introduction and uptake across six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), three delivery platforms and 69 Gavi-supported countries. Data were gathered from public, partner and manufacturer records. VPDs and prequalified vaccines analysed included Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-HepB-Hib, pentavalent), pneumococcal disease (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV), rotavirus diarrhoea (rotavirus vaccine, RVV), cervical cancer (human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV), polio (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) and meningococcal meningitis (meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine, MenA). Results Median time from first vaccine licensure to first Gavi-supported country introduction across VPDs at a 'global level' (Gavi-supported countries) was 5.4 years. Once licensed, MenA vaccines reached first introduction fastest (campaign=0.6 years; routine immunisation (RI)=1.7 years). Most introductions were delayed. Country uptake following first introduction was accelerated for more recently Gavi-supported RI vaccines compared with older ones. Conclusion Factors accelerating timelines across delivery platforms included rapid product prequalifications by WHO, strong initial recommendations by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, achieving target product profiles on first vaccine licensure within a VPD and completing several VPD milestones at a global level prior to licensure. Milestones required for introduction in Gavi-supported countries should start prior or in parallel to licensure to accelerate uptake of vaccines delivered through diverse delivery platforms.

AB This study examined the impact of armed conflict on public health surveillance systems, the limitations of traditional surveillance in this context, and innovative strategies to overcome these limitations. A qualitative case study was conducted to examine the factors affecting the functioning of poliovirus surveillance in conflict-affected areas of Borno state, Nigeria using semi-structured interviews of a purposeful sample of participants. The main inhibitors of surveillance were inaccessibility, the destroyed health infrastructure, and the destroyed communication network. These three challenges created a situation in which the traditional polio surveillance system could not function. Three strategies to overcome these challenges were viewed by respondents as the most impactful. First, local community informants were recruited to conduct surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in children in the inaccessible areas. Second, the informants engaged in local-level negotiation with the insurgency groups to bring children with paralysis to accessible areas for investigation and sample collection. Third, GIS technology was used to track the places reached for surveillance and vaccination and to estimate the size and location of the inaccessible population. A modified monitoring system tracked tailored indicators including the number of places reached for surveillance and the number of acute flaccid paralysis cases detected and investigated, and utilized GIS technology to map the reach of the program. The surveillance strategies used in Borno were successful in increasing surveillance sensitivity in an area of protracted conflict and inaccessibility. This approach and some of the specific strategies may be useful in other areas of armed conflict.

AB Purpose:To identify factors associated with falls in Japanese polio survivors and assess the extent of their impact. Materials and methods:Subjects were 128 polio survivors. Fall history and fear of falling, lower limb muscle strength, gait ability (determined by walking speed and number of steps per day), post-polio syndrome incidence, and orthosis or walking aid use were assessed, and factors associated with falls were identified using logistic regression analysis. Results:The fall rate was 64%. Fallers (subjects with one or more falls in the preceding 12 months) had low lower limb muscle strength, slow walking speed, high total scores on the Fall Efficacy Scale-International, which assesses fear of falling, and a high orthosis use rate. Knee extension muscle strength on the weaker side was identified as a main factor influencing risk of falls (odds ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.96). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis gave a cutoff value for knee extension muscle strength on the weaker side of 0.42 N/kg or lower. Conclusion:Low knee extension muscle strength on the weaker side was associated with falls, but predictive ability using a single internal factor might be poor. It appears that a comprehensive examination, including other factors, is required.

AB Introduction The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is a global single-disease programme with an extensive infrastructure in some of the world's most underserved areas. It provides a key example of the opportunities and challenges of transition efforts-the process of shifting from donor-funded, single-disease programmes to programmes with more integrated and sustainable programmatic and funding streams. Our goal is to closely analyse the social and political dynamics of the polio transition in the 2010s to provide insights into today, as well as lessons for other programmes.Methods We conducted semistructured interviews with GPEI officials involved in transition planning across GPEI partner agencies (n=11). We also drew on document review and interviews with national and subnational actors in Nigeria, India, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We inductively analysed this material to capture emergent themes in the evolution of transition activities in the GPEI.Results Since the mid-2010s, GPEI actors expressed concern that polio's assets should not be lost when polio was eradicated. Planning for polio's legacy, however, proved complicated. The GPEI's commitment to and focus on eradication had taken precedence over strong collaborations outside the polio programme, making building alliances for transition challenging. There were also complex questions around who should be responsible for the transition process, and which agencies would ultimately pay for and deliver polio-funded functions. Current efforts to achieve 'integration' both have great promise and must grapple with these same issues.Discussion Within the GPEI, relinquishing control to other programmes and planning for significant, long-term funding for transition will be central to achieving successful integration and eventual transition. Beyond polio, other vertical programmes can benefit from going beyond transition 'planning' to integrate transition into the initial design of vertical programmes.

AB The reappearance of polio in Chad generates anxieties about governance as well as public health. Since Chad was declared polio-free in 2003, at least 180 cases of paralytic polio have been linked to importations of wild poliovirus from Nigeria. In efforts to eradicate polio through houseto-house vaccination campaigns, international agencies have aggressively implicated political leaders, placing those authorities in a bind. On the one hand, governments are required to demonstrate compliance in the form of universal vaccination. On the other hand, the legitimacy of political leaders and of local authorities in particular depends upon their ability to show compassion for their populations and to be responsive to individual circumstances and concerns about the drops. This article looks at how the obligation of the African state to adopt global public health policy as its own becomes problematic when the goals and protocols of international agencies rely on the assumption that the state controls its population. Under pressure to render account to international agencies, state officials deploy high-level politicians to enforce vaccination mandates at critical moments, create administrative forms to record campaign progress that conceal difficulties in vaccinating children, and use statistics to portray the campaigns as success stories. Local authorities, who feel the bind most acutely, grant exceptions to the mandate of universal vaccination to certain subjects and work with local vaccinators and supervisors to keep cases of unvaccinated children 'off the record'. These efforts allow the vaccination campaigns to be carried out without incident even as they work against the goal of polio eradication.

AB The official NO-DO newsreels were screened in Spain on a weekly basis from 1943 to 1981. These official news and documentary programmes were compulsory in cinemas from the moment they were first produced until the end of the Francoist dictatorship (1975). NO-DO held an information monopoly and was used as the regime's propaganda tool to indoctrinate the population, building stories tailored to the regime's interests and masking social realities. In this study, we examined newsreels on medical subjects relating to diseases preventable by vaccination. A majority of reports centred on poliomyelitis, and two differentiated periods could be defined, coinciding with the development of Franco regime's foreign policy. Further, from the gender perspective, we analyse the female stereotypes in the battle against vaccine preventable diseases Therefore, the news coverage of polio is of special relevance. In conclusion, this topic offers a good opportunity to reflect on the political role of popular science and science communication in a specific historical context. (C) 2019 SESPAS.

AB Introduction This study investigated the association between preserved lower-limb muscle strength, dynamic and static postural stability, risk of falling, and fear of falling in polio survivors. We also investigated whether these clinical features differ between polio survivors and healthy controls.Methods:This quasi-experimental study enrolled 16 polio survivors (13 underwent a complete-case analysis) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants were assessed by the manual muscle test, Berg Balance Scale, force platform posturography, and Falls Efficacy Scale. Between-group mean differences with confidence intervals (MD, CI 95%) and Spearman's rho are reported.Results:Compared to healthy controls, polio survivors presented reduced muscle strength (MD = -13, CI 95% -16 to -9 points), lower dynamic postural stability (MD = -14, CI 95% -19 to -8 points), and increased fear of falling (MD = 14, CI 95% 10-18 points) (allP < 0.001). In polio survivors, lower-limb muscle strength was correlated with dynamic (rho = 0.760) and static postural stability (rho = 0.738-0.351), risk of falling (rho = -0.746), and fear of falling (rho = -0.432). Dynamic postural stability was correlated with risk of falling (rho = -0.841), fear of falling (rho = -0.277), and static postural stability (rho = -0.869 to -0.435;rho = -0.361 to -0.200, respectively). Risk and fear of falling were also correlated (rho = 0.464).Discussion:Polio survivors exhibited impaired dynamic postural stability but preserved static stability and increased risk of falling and fear of falling. Preserved lower-limb muscle strength, postural stability, fear of falling, and risk of falling are associated clinical features in this population.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate by means of classical test theory and Rasch analysis the scaling characteristics and psychometric properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in polio survivors. A questionnaire, consisting of five general questions (sex, age, age at time of acute polio, sequelae of polio, and new symptoms), the FSS, and three questions from the Visual Analog Scale questions on fatigue was sent to all 196 polio survivors at the Institute for Rehabilitation in Ljubljana. Responses were assessed in terms of Cronbach's alpha, item-to-total correlation, factor analysis, and Rasch analysis. Of the 128 (65.3%) valid questionnaires returned, those presenting no missing values were used for subsequent analyses (n = 117). The FSS showed good internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.95, item-to-total correlation ranged from 0.68 to 0.88. A reduction from seven to three rating categories was necessary to comply with criteria for correct category function. Item difficulty estimates spanned from - 0.91 to + 1.09 logits. No item bias was found for sex and age. The internal consistency of FSS was high and its item separation reliability good, indicating a satisfactory replicability of item placement in other samples. In conclusion, Rasch analysis enabled us to confirm the validity of FSS (in its 8-item version, without item 1) as a measure of the severity and impact of physical symptoms of fatigue in polio survivors, so providing a useful starting point for further studies aimed at examining additional psychometric aspects and confirming the appropriateness of the simplification of its rating categories.

TI MEASURING FATIGUE IN POLIO SURVIVORS: CONTENT COMPARISON AND RELIABILITY
   OF THE FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE AND THE CHECKLIST INDIVIDUAL STRENGTH

AB Objectives: (i) To compare the content of the Fatigue Severity Scale and the subscale "subjective experience of fatigue" of the Checklist Individual Strength, and (ii) to assess the reliability of both questionnaires in polio survivors.
   Design: Repeated-measures at a 3-week interval.
   Subjects: Consecutive series of 61 polio survivors.
   Methods: Concepts contained in the questionnaire items were linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), using standardized linking rules. Reliability analyses included tests of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and measurement error.
   Results: Questionnaires differed in the extent to which they measured other than fatigue-related aspects of functioning (represented ICF components: "Body functions": 50% and 80%, "Activities and Participation": 30% and 0%, for the Fatigue Severity Scale and Checklist Individual Strength, respectively). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were considered acceptable, while measurement error was large (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90 and 0.93, intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.80 and 0.85, smallest detectable change: 28.7% and 29.4% for the Fatigue Severity Scale and Checklist Individual Strength, respectively).
   Conclusion: Considering the acceptable clinimetric properties, we conclude that both the Fatigue Severity Scale and the Checklist Individual Strength can be applied in research on post-poliomyelitis syndrome when measuring fatigue. However, because the 2 questionnaires differ in content they cannot be used interchangeably.

AB One goal of the scientific research enterprise is to improve the lives of individuals and the overall health of societies. This goal is achieved through a combination of factors, including the composition of research portfolios. In turn, this composition is determined by a variety of scientific and societal needs. The recent history of polio research highlights the complex relations between research policy, scientific progress and societal benefits. Here, we briefly review the circumstances leading to the possibility of eradication of poliovirus, evaluate the research environment that emerged following the introduction of a vaccine, and compare and contrast the current research framework with that for other infectious diseases. From this analysis, policy lessons with general applicability to scientfic research are identified.

AB OBJECTIVE To determine whether a nurse-initiated chart review and prompt to physicians is an effective method to increase immunization rates.
   STUDY DESIGN This study was a controlled trial with systematic assignment of children to intervention or control groups based on chart number. Each day, a nurse reviewed the charts of children to be seen that day who were in the intervention group. The nurse prepared a 1-page form about the child's immunization status that requested permission from the physician to administer needed vaccines and attached the form to the chart. The duration of the study period was 1 year.
   POPULATION Nine hundred ninety-seven pediatric patients attending 2 inner-city primary, care health centers.
   OUTCOME MEASURED On-time immunization rates in both groups.
   RESULTS Among children eligible to receive vaccines during the study period, a higher percentage in the intervention group received on-time vaccines for diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis-4 (DTP4; 51% vs 36%; P =.03), oral polio vaccine-3 (OPV3; 70% vs 56%, P = .04), and measles/mumps/rubella-1 (42% vs 26%; P =.01) than did children in the control group. No statistically significant differences were noted for DTP3, DTP5, hepatitis 133, or OPV4. No statistically significant difference was noted for the combined series (ie, all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by the 1995 Childhood Immunization Schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
   CONCLUSIONS The chart prompt increased on-time immunizations for some antigens.

AB A combination of high infant immunization coverage and surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, plays a critical role in polio eradication. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of AFP, to evaluate the completeness of AFP ascertainment during the years, age groups and gender, and to define the main associated diagnosis among children aged under 15 in the Marches region of Italy. Analysis was performed on data from the active AFP surveillance system and the hospital discharge records in the 2006-2014 period. The two-source capture-recapture method was applied. After cross-validation, 30 AFP compatible conditions as defined by the WHO were identified, with an incidence estimate of 1.91 cases of AFP per 100,000 children under 15 years (95% CI = 1.4-2.6/100,000). Guillain-Barre syndrome was the most common diagnosis. A significant difference (p < 0.05) has been registered in the estimated probability of case ascertainment in females. The reasons for the lower reporting of cases in females are unknown. Specific research and the implementation of a more sensitive surveillance system are essential in verifying potential inequalities and to succeed in the polio eradication initiative.

AB This paper examines the impact changing ventilation technology and the ideologies of rehabilitation medicine on the long-term adaptations of people with post-polio respiratory disability. Multiple in-depth interviews with 10 respirator-dependent people indicates that cultural ideologies learned during rehabilitation continue to effect the adoption of technology and daily management of respiratory insufficiency. Adaptive strategies through which benefits of technology are maximized and the social costs minimized, have transformed rehabilitation ideologies and moderated the late, aging-related effects of poliomyelitis.

AB Sweden today may be described as multicultural. Those who are immigrants and have a disability are described as doubly vulnerable. Aims: To explore and describe how immigrants with late effects of polio experience their daily occupations. Method: The experiences were explored by interviews with 12 immigrants with late effects of polio, from Eastern Africa. Data analysis was carried out according to grounded theory. Results: Experiences in daily occupations affected the participants' view of the future, which in turn was influenced by the participants' conception of occupational self. This was dependent on their participation in daily occupations. Five categories influenced their experiences: rootedness in society, estimation of others, treatment by others, belonging to social networks, and the process of change in life. The social environment played an important role in determining how the participants experienced their daily occupations. Conclusions: The participants' experiences could not be seen in isolation; consequences of their disability and migration interact. The study showed that the complexity of daily life among immigrants with disability requires individual treatment and points to a need for consideration of differences in cultural background, including the therapist's own cultural lens.

AB Objective: To explore how persons with late effects of polio experience falls and what strategies they use to manage the consequences of falls.
   Design: A qualitative study with face-to-face interviews. Data were analysed by systematic text condensation.
   Participants: Fourteen ambulatory persons (7 women; mean age 70 years) with late effects of polio.
   Results: Analysis resulted in one main theme, "Everyday life is a challenge to avoid the consequences of falls", and 3 categories with 7 subcategories. Participants perceived that falls were unpredictable and could occur anywhere. Even slightly uneven surfaces could cause a fall, and increased impairments following late effects of polio led to reduced movement control and an inability to adjust balance quickly. Physical injuries were described after the falls, as well as emotional and psychological reactions, such as embarrassment, frustration and fear of falling. Assistive devices, careful planning and strategic thinking were strategies to prevent falls, together with adaptation and social comparisons to mitigate the emotional reactions.
   Conclusion: Experiences of falls greatly affect persons with late effects of polio in daily life. To reduce falls and fall-related consequences both problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies are used. In order to increase daily functioning, these findings should be included

AB The many challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean region put the involved countries at risk of polio transmission and affect their ability to meet progress targets in eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases. The Global Health Development (GHD) and Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) are working together on the project "Strengthening sustainable public health capacity in the Eastern Mediterranean region for polio eradication and routine immunization activities" with an overall goal of improving routine immunization, eradicating poliovirus, and controlling/eliminating or eradicating other vaccine-preventable diseases in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The aim of this manuscript is to describe the project and the achievements of GHD/EMPHNET over the last 3 years (2016-2018) to build effective surveillance and immunization systems in the Eastern Mediterranean region through the development of a sustainable and competent public health system to eradicate polio and control/eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases. This project assists the targeted Eastern Mediterranean region countries to build effective surveillance and immunization systems in an effort to expand their capacities to eradicate polio and control/eliminate other vaccine-preventable diseases. The project is streamlined with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic Framework for Global Immunization 2016-2020, and the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018. The project also supports the Global Health Security Agenda by focusing on efforts to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats. Project activities were designed to respond to countries' needs and assist them in building their institutional and workforce capacity to effectively plan, implement, and evaluate activities to eradicate polio and strengthen routine immunization activities. The project activities covered a set of areas including surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis and other vaccine-preventable diseases, family and community engagement, workforce capacity building, improvement of data quality, management and use of information systems, use of polio assets to control/eliminate other vaccine-preventable diseases, support of countries to develop national strategies, piloting of innovative initiatives, program evaluation and accountability, and immunization strengthening. The project adopts the Global Polio Eradication Initiative strategies for assisting countries to strengthen routine immunization services, maintain highly sensitive acute flaccid paralysis surveillance, and sustain polio eradication functions.

AB Acute paralytic poliomyelitis causes diffuse injury to the motor neuron pool. The clinical picture is determined by the extent of motor neuron loss; however, clinically unaffected segments may have suffered substantial viral injury. The individual that suffered acute paralytic poliomyelitis carries the burden of a depleted motor neuron pool and often a residual biomechanical deficit into aging. This interaction often results in late effects of new muscle weakness, prominent fatigue, and sometimes new muscle atrophy with aging, called the postpolio syndrome. Cardiovascular and conventional muscle strengthening exercises must be initiated with caution in the patient with postpolio syndrome. Previously injured and altered motor units may have chronic relative overuse. Training will further stress these units and may accelerate declining performance. The goal of exercise and muscle training should be carefully considered in the postpolio patient. Nonspecific muscle strengthening exercise is generally undesirable unless applied to clearly unaffected or only minimally affected muscle groups. Exercise for cardiovascular fitness is more desirable and carries less risk of exacerbating overuse if applied with caution. When exercise is initiated, it should be punctuated by rest periods, and the intensity must not exceed a level that produces pain or more than transient fatigue.

AB Respiratory dysfunction is extremely common and entails considerable risk of morbidity and mortality for individuals with past poliomyelitis. Although it is usually primarily due to respiratory muscle weakness, postpoliomyelitis individuals also have a high incidence of scoliosis, obesity, sleep disordered breathing, and bulbar muscle dysfunction. Although these factors can result in chronic alveolar hypoventilation (CAH) and frequent pulmonary complications and hospitalizations, CAH is usually not recognized until acute respiratory failure complicates an otherwise benign upper respiratory tract infection. The use of non-invasive inspiratory and expiratory muscle aids, however, can decrease the risk of acute respiratory failure, hospitalizations for respiratory complications, and need to resort to tracheal intubation. Timely introduction of non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), manually assisted coughing, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) and non-invasive blood gas monitoring which can most often be performed in the home setting, are the principle interventions for avoiding complications and maintaining optimal quality of life.

AB Polio-virus isolation after feeding Sabin type I and type III vaccines was undertaken in children experiencing febrile episodes and in afebrile control children. The resulting isolates were examined for rct and E (elution) marker deviations. For both markers, deviations from the vaccine character were more common among isolates from children under 1 year, among isolates from specimens collected after a prolonged postvaccination interval, and among type III isolates. Differences related to febrile status were not significant. Changes in the 2 markers studied appeared to occur with no interdependence.

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Background: Nigeria's government is challenged with vaccinating the world's third largest birth cohort within a culturally and socioeconomically diverse country. This study estimated full childhood immunization coverage in Nigeria and characterizes the association between vaccination status and urbanicity, region of residence, ethnicity, and other factors.
   Methods: In 2013, households throughout Nigeria were enrolled in the Demographic and Health Survey which included questions about vaccination. We defined full vaccination of a child as having received a single dose of bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG), one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), three doses of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Using a multinomial logistic regression model, full vaccination and under-vaccination versus non-vaccination was regressed onto various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
   Results: Among 5759 children 1 year of age, 25.5% were fully vaccinated, 47.9% were under-vaccinated, and 26.6% had not received any vaccinations. Children were more likely to be fully vaccinated if they belonged to wealthier families, resided in southern regions of the country, were Christian, belonged to the lgbo or Yoruba ethnic group, had mothers who made >= 5 antenatal care visits, delivered at an institution, or were more highly educated.
   Conclusions: Full vaccination among children in Nigeria is exceptionally low by global standards and certain groups, such as Muslims and individuals in northern regions who are higher risk of non- or under vaccination should be targeted by vaccination programs. Providing a wide range of health care services for mothers and pregnant women could improve full vaccination of children. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE
AB Background: Vaccination programs are one of the priority health interventions, and all children in every country should be vaccinated. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims for 90% coverage of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) by the age of 12 months. The CORE Group Polio Project (CGPP) Ethiopia implemented interventions in pastoral and semi-pastoral regions to increase routine immunization coverage and support supplemental immunization campaigns.
   Objective: Assess vaccination coverage, estimate dropout rates and identify associated factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study using the modified WHO EPI cluster survey method was conducted as part of the mid-term evaluation in 2015 in six pastoral and semi-pastoral zones in Ethiopia. A sample of 600 children age 12 to 23 months was selected, and mothers/caregivers were interviewed at home using face-to-face interviews, supported by mobile data collection using the Open Data Kit (ODK) system. Data were exported from the server, cleaned, and analysed using STATA 12.0.Both descriptive analytical methods were used and p-values less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.
   Results: Of the estimated sample, 577 (96.6%) children were included in the analysis. The overall rate of full vaccination was estimated to be 44.0% (21.2% in pastoral areas and 71.6% in semi-pastoralareas). With vaccine specific coverage of 53.7% for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG); 58.8% for oral polio vaccine 3 (OPV 3); 58.8% for pentavalent 3; 56.3% for OCV 3 and 53.6% for measles. Mothers'/caregivers' residence, age and education were found to be significant predictors for children not being fully vaccinated, i.e. children of mothers living in pastoralist communities, young age, and with no education were at a significantly higher risk of being not fully vaccinated. Among those children who had at least one vaccine, 20.5% failed to take at least one of the next higher doses. Specifically, among those who took BCG and pentavalent 1, 10.1% and 14.1%, respectively, failed to take the measles vaccination.
   Conclusions and recommendations: The proportion of children who were fully vaccinated in pastoral and semipastoral zones was low. Dropout rates for measles, BCG and pentavalent 1 immunization were above the acceptable rate of less than 10%. Therefore, efforts should focus on mobilizing the community to complete all child vaccinations, and community-based approaches with the integration of community volunteers, health extension workers and health center staff should be strengthened so that dropout children can be traced so that they can complete their vaccinations. More information is also required on why mothers/caregivers fail to ensure that their children take all available vaccinations.

AB The aim of this pilot study was to assess the association between perceived environmental barriers and perceived participation in everyday life situations encountered by people with late effects of polio. A sample of 45 persons with clinically verified late effects of polio answered the Swedish versions of the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPA-S) and the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors (CHIEF-S). The relationships between the perceived occurrence of a broad range of environmental barriers and perception of participation in life situations and problems with participation were explored. The majority of the respondents perceived that they encountered environmental barriers, but their occurrence was generally infrequent and their magnitude tended to be low. The barriers identified in the physical/structural subscale were generally most strongly related to problems with participation, compared with the four other environmental subscales. A high frequency of never encountering environmental barriers in the three subscales physical/structural, work and education, and policies in CHIEF-S were significantly related to more reports of good participation in IPA-S. These associations indicate that the participation of those with late effects of polio is influenced by their perception of the barriers they encounter. Further studies of these concepts can provide a greater understanding of disabilities and help us to promote participation in life situations for people with late effects of polio.

AB Eradication of a disease promises significant health and financial benefits. Preserving those benefits, hopefully in perpetuity, requires preparing for the possibility that the causal agent could re-emerge (unintentionally or intentionally). In the case of a vaccine-preventable disease, creation and planning for the use of a vaccine stockpile becomes a primary concern. Doing so requires consideration of the dynamics at different levels, including the stockpile supply chain and transmission of the causal agent. This paper develops a mathematical framework for determining the optimal management of a vaccine stockpile over time. We apply the framework to the polio vaccine stockpile for the post-eradication era and present examples of solutions to one possible framing of the optimization problem. We use the framework to discuss issues relevant to the development and use of the polio vaccine stockpile, including capacity constraints, production and filling delays, risks associated with the stockpile, dynamics and uncertainty of vaccine needs, issues of funding, location, and serotype dependent behavior, and the implications of likely changes over time that might occur. This framework serves as a helpful context for discussions and analyses related to the process of designing and maintaining a stockpile for an eradicated disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI THE EFFECT OF PATIENT EDUCATION ON PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATION RATES

AB Background. Over the last decade, the immunization rate among preschool children has decreased, especially in the lower socioeconomic population. During this period, reports of outbreaks of immunizable diseases, especially pertussis and measles, have correspondingly increased. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of a brief patient education encounter with new mothers on pediatric immunization rates.
   Methods. Two hundred thirty-eight mothers and infants were assigned to an intervention or control group. On the first day postpartum, the mothers in the intervention group participated in a 10- to 15-minute discussion on the importance of immunizations and were given a patient education handout. A reminder letter was mailed to the intervention group at 2 months postpartum. The control group received no special intervention. Infants were followed for their 2- and 4-month immunizations for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus and oral polio vaccine (DPT/OPV). At 1 year of age, the infants immunization records were assessed for the completion of their first three DPT/OPV immunizations.
   Results. There was no statistically significant difference, by chi-square analysis, in the immunization rates of the control and intervention groups at 2, 4, or 12 months of age. At 1 year of age, 29 of 122 (24%) of the control group had received all three DPT/OPV immunizations, compared with 33 (28%) of 116 infants in the intervention group.
   Conclusion. Concordant with similar studies, the immunization rate among infants of parents of lower socioeconomic status (26%) is low. An educational intervention presented to mothers in the postpartum period did not improve the rate of immunization by the age of 12 months. There are undoubtedly several reasons for this failure. Other means to improve immunization rates of infants should be developed and tested.

AB Objective: To design a disease-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire for people with post-polio syndrome (PPS).
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 45 people with PPS to identify themes and derive potential items reflecting impact upon QoL. After cognitive debriefing, these were made into a questionnaire pack along with comparative questionnaires and posted to 319 patients. The 271 (85%) returned questionnaires were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Rasch analysis.
   Results: A 25 item scale, the post-polio quality of life scale (PP-QoL), showed good fit to the Rasch model (conditional chi-square p = 0.156), unidimensionality (% t-tests 2.0: CI 0.7-3.8), and Cronbach's alpha of 0.87. With the latent estimate transformed to a 0-100 scale, the mean score was 56.9 (SD 18.5) with only 3.3% of respondents at the floor or ceiling of the scale. Test-retest reliability showed an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (2.1) of 0.916, and correlation of 0.85.
   Conclusion: The disease-specific PP-QoL demonstrated excellent reliability, appropriate concurrent validity, and satisfied the standards of the Rasch model. It enables examination of the impact of health status upon perceived QoL, and the impact of rehabilitation interventions. The scale is freely available for academic or not-for-profit users to improve research in this neglected, disabling condition.

TI Factors associated with incomplete child immunization in Pakistan:
   findings from Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Immunization; Children; Pakistan; Risk factors; PDHS
AB Objective: The objective of this analysis was to explore the determinants of incomplete immunization in children aged 12-23 months. Study design: A secondary analysis was conducted on cross-sectional survey data from Pakistan Demographic and Health survey 2017-2018. Methods: The present study was confined to children aged 12-23 months at the time of survey giving a sample size of 2048. Complete immunization was described as having received a dose of BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin), four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV0, OPV1, OPV2, and OPV3), three doses of pentavalent and pneumococcal vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between outcome and predictor variables. Results: The findings showed that the likelihood of being incompletely immunized was higher for the children of Baluchistan (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.18-9.71), Federally Administered Tribal Areas (aOR = 6.2; 95% CI = 3.97-9.71), Sindh (aOR = 3.24; 95% CI = 2.33 -4.49), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (aOR = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.54-2.97), Islamabad (aOR = 3.656; 95% CI = 2.34 -5.69), and Gilgit Baltistan (aOR = 2.320; 95% CI = 1.50-3.57) relative to those of Punjabi children. Lower odds of partial vaccination were seen among the children of educated mothers (primary or higher) and those who were born at a health facility. Conclusion: Improving maternal literacy rate, providing easy access to health facilities, and minimizing regional disparities can improve the immunization status of children in Pakistan.

TI Global health goals: lessons from the worldwide effort to eradicate
   poliomyelitis
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIO ERADICATION; IMPACT
AB The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988. Assessment of the politics, production, financing, and economics of this international effort has suggested six lessons that might be pertinent to the pursuit of other global health goals. First, such goals should be based on technically sound strategies with proven operational feasibility in a large geographical area. Second, before launching an initiative, an informed collective decision must be negotiated and agreed in an appropriate international forum to keep to a minimum long-term risks in financing and implementation. Third, if substantial community engagement is envisaged, efficient deployment of sufficient resources at that level necessitates a defined, time-limited input by the community within a properly managed partnership. Fourth, although the so-called fair-share concept is arguably the best way to finance such goals, its limitations must be recognised early and alternative strategies developed for settings where it does not work. Fifth, international health goals must be designed and pursued within existing health systems if they are to secure and sustain broad support. Finally, countries, regions, or populations most likely to delay the achievement of a global health goal should be identified at the outset to ensure provision of sufficient resources and attention. The greatest threats to poliomyelitis eradication are a financing gap of US$210 million and difficulties in strategy implementation in at most five countries.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe experiences of attitudes in the society of Sierra Leone from the perspective of individuals with poliomyelitis and people with amputations using orthotic or prosthetic devices.
   Methods: Individual interviews were conducted using open-ended questions. Twelve participants with amputations or polio were included. Content analysis was applied to the data.
   Results: The following six themes emerged during data analysis: Experience of negative attitudes; Neglected and respected by family; Traditional beliefs; The importance of assistive devices; People with disability struggle with poverty; and The need for governmental and international support.
   Conclusions: In Sierra Leone, people with disabilities face severe discrimination. They need to be included, recognized, and supported to a greater extent by the society, the community, and the family, as well as by the government and international organizations. Traditional beliefs have a negative impact on people with physical disabilities and are an important cause of discrimination in Sierra Leone. Prosthetic and orthotic devices are vital for people with physical disability and offer increased dignity. Prosthetic and orthotic services need to be accessible and affordable. Poverty affects access to education, employment, and health care for Sierra Leoneans with physical disabilities, forcing them to resort to begging to cover basic living needs.

AB Purpose: Polio survivors experience declining mobility, pain and fatigue. The extent of motor fatigue and its impact on mobility and quality of life, in addition to other commonly reported impairments requires evaluation. Methods: An observational, case-control, cross-sectional design was used to assess 30 Polio survivors and 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Muscle strength and motor fatigue were assessed using fixed dynamometry. Fatigue, pain and quality of life were assessed using the Piper Fatigue Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, visual analogue scales and the RAND Short Form-36, respectively. An 8-min walking test, including physiological cost index (PCI), evaluated mobility. Results: A significant difference in motor fatigue was identified only in hand grip (p = 0.03). Polio survivors were significantly weaker (p<0.001) and more fatigued (p<0.001) than controls. Motor fatigue was not related to subjective fatigue, mobility or quality of life. Muscle strength predicted mobility. Pain and fatigue were associated with lower mental quality of life, while PCI was associated with physical quality of life. Conclusion: Motor fatigue has been identified in Polio survivors but was only significantly different in hand grip, using this approach. Pain, fatigue and elevated energy cost of walking negatively influenced quality of life. Motor fatigue was unrelated to subjective fatigue, mobility or quality of life.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the association between physical activity and self-reported disability in ambulatory persons with mild to moderate late effects of polio (N = 81, mean age 67 years). The outcome measures were: Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS), a pedometer, Self-Reported Impairments in Persons with Late Effects of Polio Scale (SIPP), Walking Impact Scale (Walk-12), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and self-reported incidence of falls. The participants were physically active on average 158 min per day and walked 6,212 steps daily. Significant associations were found between PADS and Walk-12 (r = -. 31, p <.001), and between the number of steps and SIPP, Walk-12, and FES-I (r = -. 22 to -. 32, p <.05). Walk-12 and age explained 14% of the variance in PADS and FES-I explained 9% of the variance in number of steps per day. Thus, physical activity was only weakly to moderately associated with self-reported disability.

AB Aims: Kawasaki disease is an acute pediatric vasculitis whose etiology remains unknown but epidemiology and clinical presentation suggest a viral etiology. We performed unbiased high-throughput-sequencing on blood of patients with Kawasaki Disease (KD). Materials and Methods: High-throughput-sequencing was performed directly on blood of children with typical KD. Sequences were aligned against a database of clinically relevant viruses. Results: Four patients were acutely infected in the blood, with respectively, poliovirus (vaccine strain), measles (vaccine strain), rhinovirus and bocavirus. Patients with poliovirus and measles had received oral polio and measles vaccines, respectively, twelve and 2 weeks prior. Conclusion: Viral signatures were identified in more than half of the patients, including some corresponding to their vaccinal history. This could suggest a temporal association with KD.

TI A population-based survey of immunisation coverage in two-year-old
   children
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID IMMUNIZATION STATUS; MEASLES
AB A cross-sectional, population-based, cluster-sample survey of 187 children was conducted in the Newcastle area to assess the proportion of two-year-old children who were fully immunised, to ascertain whether administration of these vaccines was age-appropriate and to look for factors predicting incomplete immunisation. Parents or guardians were interviewed at their homes and the immunisation status of the children was verified either by the parent-held record or by the immunisation-provider-held record. Levels of full immunisation were 77 per cent at the time of interview and 72 per cent at the second birthday if Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was excluded. If it was included, the full immunisation level was 51 per cent. Coverage was highest for oral polio vaccine and lowest for Hib vaccine. Twenty-nine per cent of all immunisations were given early, 44 per cent were given on time and 20 per cent were given late. Doses of vaccines due at older ages were more likely to be given late or not at all. Factors predicting incomplete immunisation were: the principal caregiver being aged under 25 years, being born outside Australia, having post-secondary qualifications, being female and having more than one child in the household. Immunisation coverage levels were not high enough to protect against outbreaks of pertussis and measles and cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b. Immunisation providers should aim to increase coverage to protect the population against all vaccine preventable diseases, and aiming at high-risk groups could more effectively do this.

DT Article

   EVOLUTION; AREAS; RISK
AB Objective To explore the extent to which undervaccinated subpopulations may influence the confidence about no circulation of wild poliovirus (WPV) after the last detected case.
   Design and participants We used a hypothetical model to examine the extent to which the existence of an undervaccinated subpopulation influences the confidence about no WPV circulation after the last detected case as a function of different characteristics of the subpopulation (eg, size, extent of isolation). We also used the hypothetical population model to inform the bounds on the maximum possible time required to reach high confidence about no circulation in a completely isolated and unvaccinated subpopulation starting either at the endemic equilibrium or with a single infection in an entirely susceptible population.
   Results It may take over 3 years to reach 95% confidence about no circulation for this hypothetical population despite high surveillance sensitivity and high vaccination coverage in the surrounding general population if: (1) ability to detect cases in the undervaccinated subpopulation remains exceedingly small, (2) the undervaccinated subpopulation remains small and highly isolated from the general population and (3) the coverage in the undervaccinated subpopulation remains very close to the minimum needed to eradicate. Fully-isolated hypothetical populations of 4000 people or less cannot sustain endemic transmission for more than 5 years, with at least 20 000 people required for a 50% chance of at least 5 years of sustained transmission in a population without seasonality that starts at the endemic equilibrium. Notably, however, the population size required for persistent transmission increases significantly for realistic populations that include some vaccination and seasonality and/ or that do not begin at the endemic equilibrium.
   Conclusions Significant trade-offs remain inherent in global polio certification decisions, which underscore the need for making and valuing investments to maximise population immunity and surveillance quality in all remaining possible WPV reservoirs.

AB Purpose : The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the process of adaptation in persons with poliomyelitis sequelae with reference to daily occupations. In addition, changes in ability in activities in daily living (ADL) and in the use of assistive devices over a 4-5 year period will be described.
   Method: Qualitative interviews with 22 persons with poliomyelitis sequelae were content analysed according to grounded theory. Ability in personal and instrumental ADL was assessed.
   Results : The core category 'coming to a changed approach' towards the shift in one's capabilities describes two integrated processes: one deals with the process of realization and reorganization; the other consists of six patterns of behaviour in daily occupations. The persons had a high degree of independence in personal ADL, whereas the dependence in cleaning, shopping and transportation was extensive.
   Conclusions : Flexibility in choosing strategies facilitated participation in daily occupations. Requirements for this adaptive pattern were time, energy and ability to solve problems, accessible environments, access to information and support, and readiness to compensate with assistive devices.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess muscle strength in the knee extensors, knee flexors and ankle dorsiflexors in persons with late effects of polio, and determine how much muscle strength, gender, age and BMI are related to gait performance.
   METHODS: Ninety community-dwelling ambulant persons (47 men and 43 women; mean age 64 years SD 8) with late effects of polio participated. Isokinetic concentric knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was measured at 60 degrees/s and ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength at 30 degrees/s. Gait performance was assessed by the Timed "Up & Go", the Comfortable and Fast Gait Speed tests, and the 6-Minute Walk test.
   RESULTS: There were significant correlations between knee extensor and flexor muscle strength and gait performance (p < 0.01), and between ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength and gait performance (p < 0.05), for both lower limbs. Muscle strength in the knee extensors and flexors explained 7% to 37% and 9% to 47%, respectively, of the variance in gait performance. Strength in the ankle dorsiflexors explained 4% to 24%, whereas gender, age and BMI contributed at most an additional 9%.
   CONCLUSION: Knee muscle strength, and to some extent ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength, are predictors of gait performance in persons with late effects of polio, but the strength of the relationships indicates that other factors are also important.

TI RESPONSE OF CHICKS TO POLIOVIRUS ANTIGENS
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The results of injection of chicks with polio-virus antigen confirm the data previously reported by Timm and associates. Both studies have shown that the optimum bleeding time for determining the maximum antibody response is approximately 5 days after the second injection. Responses following single injection of antigen were also similar, except that the present studies demonstrated a higher response to type 3 virus. This merely may be a reflection of differences in total antigen concentration in the virus fluids used. When the chick poliovirus potency test is applied to preparations containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and pertussis bacterin, the peak antibody level is reached at about 5 days after the second injection. This, therefore, approximates the optimal bleeding time for birds receiving only poliovirus antigen. The antibody response, as it relates to the interval between the two antigen doses, differs between the two vaccines. With poliovaccine alone, the response is detectable in an interval of 4 days and increases as the time between injections approaches an optimum of 14 days. Quadruple vaccine requires a greater interval and the optimum period extends beyond 14 days. To assure detection of maximum response, therefore, it seems advisable to increase the dose interval to 17 days for testing chicks with quadruple antigen.

AB In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his law partner Basil O'Connor formed the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) to battle the viral disease poliomyelitis. Although the NFIP program was purported to be available for all Americans irrespective of "race, creed, or color," officials encountered numerous difficulties upholding this pledge in a nation divided by race. In 1944, NFIP officials hired educator Charles H. Bynum to head a new department of "Negro Activities." Between 1944 and 1954, Bynum negotiated the NFIP bureaucracy to educate officials and influence their national health policy. As part of the NFIP team, he helped increase interracial fund-raising in the March of Dimes, improve polio treatment for black Americans, and further the civil rights movement.

AB In New South Wales, health screening of school entrants provides the only mechanism for routine monitoring of immunisation uptake in children.  School health nurses are in the best position to improve the compliance with immunisation at this age.  We compared two interventions to be used by the nurses to increase immunisation uptake in school entrants who reported missing either the measles-mumps vaccine and/or the pre-school diptheria-tetanus toxoid and oral polio vaccine boosters.  Parents in the passive intervention group were sent a letter and leaflet encouraging immunisation; the active intervention group received a telephone reminder from the nurse in addition to the written materials.  Both groups were followed up at a later date to assess final immunisation outcome.  Of 817 children screened, 88.2% had been immunised against measles and 73.6% had received the booster; 239 children were randomised to the two interventions.  Excluding children lost to follow up and those fully immunised at the start of the study, 20 (37%) of 54 were immunised following the passive intervention, and 35 (71%) out of 49 following the active intervention (P = 0.001).  Receipt of the letter and leaflet was associated with an increased uptake of booster vaccination (P = 0.036).  The active intervention required 14.7 telephone calls and 1.6 uses of the interpreter service per completed immunisation.  The passive intervention resulted in worthwhile increases in immunisation rate with minimum cost.  A greater improvement in immunisation outcome was achieved by the active intervention, but its use was labour intensive and may only be warranted if high immunisation rates in this age-group are given priority.

AB Objectives India has more unvaccinated children than any other country despite provision of free vaccines through the government's Universal Immunization Program. In this study, we calculated the proportion of children aged 12-48 months who were fully vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or who had not received any vaccines. Childhood, household, and sociocultural factors associated with under-vaccination and non-vaccination were evaluated. Methods Using data from India's 4th District-level Health and Facility Survey, 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) and the 2012-2013 Annual Health Survey (AHS), we calculated the proportion of children who were non-vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or fully vaccinated with 1 dose of Bacillus Calmette-Gu,rin, 3 doses of oral polio vaccine, 3 doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, and 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine. The odds of full vaccination compared to non-vaccination and under-vaccination relative to various factors was assessed using a multivariable, multinomial logistic regression which accounted for survey design. Results Of 1,929,580 children aged 12-48 months, 59% were fully vaccinated, 34% were under-vaccinated, and 7% were non-vaccinated. Compared to children born in government institutions, children delivered in non-institutional settings with a skilled birth attendant present had higher odds of non-vaccination (OR 1.66) and those without a skilled attendant present had still greater odds of non-vaccination (OR 2.39) and under-vaccination (OR 1.11). Conclusions for Practice India's vaccination rates among children aged 12-48 months remains unacceptably low. The Indian government should encourage institutional delivery or birthing with a skilled attendant to ensure women receive adequate health education through antenatal care that includes the importance of childhood vaccination.

TI Hepatitis B immunisation coverage of infants born to chronic carrier

DT Article
ID SURFACE-ANTIGEN; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VACCINATION; TRANSMISSION;
   STRATEGIES; EFFICACY; PROGRAM
AB Infants born to HBsAg-(hepatitis B surface antigen) carrier mothers are highly likely to become chronic hepatitis B (HE) carriers themselves unless their status is recognised at birth and they are immunised with three doses of HE vaccine, the first within 48 hours of birth, concurrent with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). This study was designed to determine how many infants born in Victoria to carrier mothers completed three doses of HE vaccine. We sent the names of all infants of HBsAg-carrier mothers notified in Victoria between 1.7.91 and 30.6.92 to the appropriate local government immunisation providers and requested information on how many doses of HE vaccine, DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) or CDT (combined diphtheria-tetanus), and OPV (oral polio vaccine) they had received. The HBsAg-carrier prevalence of women giving birth in Victoria in 1991-92 was at least 0.52%. Of the 336 infants notified, 239 (71.1%) were recorded in local government records. Of these 239, 90.8% received at least two doses and 80.8% received at least three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. There was no significant difference in the number who received three doses of HE vaccine compared with three doses of DTP or CDT vaccine. Of the entire cohort of 336, only 57.4% were documented as being completely immunised against hepatitis B. HE immunisation coverage for these infants needs to be improved. The high rate of loss to follow-up, especially between the maternity hospital and the community, is disturbing. Mechanisms for intensive prospective follow-up of these infants should be developed to prevent loss to follow-up and to encourage full immunisation against HE. Improving HE immunisation coverage of infants in high HBsAg-prevalence ethnic groups and introduction of universal infant HE immunisation may lead to increased coverage of infants of carriers by serving as back-up mechanisms for those lost to follow-up.

TI Vaccine Wastage Assessment After Introduction of Open Vial Policy in
   Surat Municipal Corporation Area of India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Open Vial Policy (OVP); Vaccine Wastage Rate (WR); Vaccine Wastage
   Factor (WF); Pentavalent Vaccine
AB Background: As per the vaccine management policy of the Government of India all vaccine vials opened for an immunization session were discarded at the end of that session, irrespective of the type of vaccine or the number of doses remaining in the vial prior to 2013. Subsequently, open vial policy (OVP) was introduced in 2013 and should reduce both vaccine wastage as well as governmental healthcare costs for immunization. This study evaluates the vaccine wastage after introduction of the OVP and its comparison with the previous study of vaccine wastage in Surat city before implementation of OVP. It needs to mention that the vaccine policy for this period under comparison was uniform except for the OVP.
   Methods: Information regarding vaccine doses consumed and children vaccinated during immunization sessions of 24 urban health centers (UHCs) of Surat city were retrieved for the period of January 1st, 2014 to March 31st, 2014. The data were analyzed to estimate vaccine wastage rate (WR) and vaccine wastage factor (WF). In order to assess the impact of OVP, vaccine WR of this study was compared with that of previous study conducted in Surat city during January 1st, 2012 to March 31st, 2012.
   Results: The vaccine WR for oral polio vaccine (OPV) has decreased from 25% to 13.62%, while the WRs for DPT, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the pentavalent vaccine combinedly have decreased from 17.94% to 8.05%. Thus, by implementation of OVP, an estimated 747 727 doses of OPV and 343 725 doses of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus toxoid vaccine (DPT), HBV and the pentavalent vaccines combinedly have been saved in Surat city of India in a year.
   Conclusion: The implementation of the OVP in Surat city has led to a significant lowering in the vaccine wastage, leading to savings due to lower vaccine requirements.

ID DETERMINANTS
AB Background Between 2010 and 2016, the proportion of children 12-23 months of age who received full immunization in Malawi decreased from 81% to 76%. Most studies on immunization have mainly focused on the risk factors of vaccination coverage while data on dropouts and equity gaps is very scanty. Thus the aim of the present study was to describe the trend in immunization coverage, dropout rates and effective immunization coverage (EIC) among children ages 12-23 months in Malawi. Methods Secondary analyses of the cross-sectional data obtained from the three waves of the Demographic and Health Surveys (2004, 2010 and 2015-16) were conducted. Using bottleneck analysis, outputs were generated based on service coverage, demand/equity (service utilization) and quality (full immunization). The World Health Organization benchmarks were used to assess gaps in the immunization coverage indicators. Results The coverage was >90.0% in most of the antigens while full immunization status was estimated at 65%, 84% and 73% in 2004, 2010 and 2015, respectively. The highest coverage was observed in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and lowest in oral polio vaccine 1 (OPV1). OPV1 coverage was <90% in the 2004 cohort year, while pentavalent 3 (Penta3) and measles-containing vaccine 1 (MCV1) coverages were 10% in 2004. The logistic regression analyses showed that children were significantly less likely to be immunized with Penta3 and MCV1 in all cohort years compared with Penta1. Conclusions Although immunization coverage was in line with the national and district targets for various antigens, full vaccination coverage (FVC) is still lagging behind. Furthermore, the dropout rates for Penta3 and MCV1 showed upside U-shaped patterns. Thus health education, supervision and orientation of service providers are urgently needed to address disparities that are existing in FVC.

AB BACKGROUND: Sense of Coherence (SOC) is important for successful adaptation and mental well-being in people with life-long medical conditions. Late effects of polio (LEoP) often lead to a life-long disability, but no study has assessed SOC in this population.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess SOC in persons with LEoP and to explore the association between SOC, demographics (age, gender, marital status and level of education) and variables related to LEoP (age at polio onset, number of years from polio until onset of LEoP and self-rated disability).
   METHOD: Ninety-three community-dwelling persons with clinically verified LEoP responded to a postal survey with the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the associations with SOC.
   RESULTS: SOC varied considerably among the participants. The mean and median SOC-13 total sum score was 71.8 and 76 points, which is similar to age-matched non-disabled people. The number of years before onset of LEoP and self-rated disability together with the participants' marital status and level of education explained 37% (p < 0.001) of the variance in SOC.
   CONCLUSION: Persons with LEoP have a level of SOC indicating that they generally have the ability to understand, handle and being motivated when dealing with stressful events and problems arising in their lives as a result of their disability. Being married and having a higher education, living many years before onset of LEoP and perceiving a mild to moderate disability contributed to a strong SOC.

AB Objectives: This study aims to understand the effectiveness of whole-body vibration (WBV) exercises performed with home exercise program in patients with post-polio syndrome (PPS) in terms of muscle strength, fatigue, the quality of life, and laboratory parameters. Patients and methods: Between October 2015 and March 2016, a total of 14 patients (7 males, 7 females; mean age: 45.1 +/- 6.6 years; range, 34 to 57 years) who were diagnosed with PPS were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: the first group received WBV, home exercise program and patient education while the second (control) group received home exercise program and patient education. The patients were evaluated by knee isometric and isokinetic peak torque, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase at baseline and at the end of the treatment. Results: At the end of the treatment, the exercise program administered to the patients was found to be effective in increasing knee muscle strength in PPS patients (p<0.05). This difference was more apparent on the sequela side, isometric extension peak torque in the group with WBV. There was no significant change in the markers of muscle damage or NHP in both groups. Conclusion: Inclusion of WBV in home exercise program in PPS patients does not seem to be superior, except for reducing the effect of fatigue on the patient's life.

ID GOAL
AB Purpose: To explore how the rehabilitation plan influences the rehabilitation process and its outcome in people with late effects of polio participating in an individualised goal-oriented interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. Methods: Four women and two men with late effects of polio were interviewed before rehabilitation, at discharge, and at follow-up. Data were analysed according to the constant comparative method of grounded theory. Findings: The participants' experiences formed one core category: The same starting point but different rehabilitation processes. Before rehabilitation, all participants experienced a similar starting point: Naive understanding of rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, two separate processes followed. Four participants experienced their rehabilitation as being a mutually shared process that led to a process of change. They were actively engaged, using the rehabilitation plan, and working towards goals targeting a broad perspective of daily activities. The remaining two participants experienced their rehabilitation as a staff-directed process, with limited use of the rehabilitation plan, focusing on goals mainly related to body functions and self-care, not leading to any substantial changes. Conclusion: When clients experience that they develop a mutually shared rehabilitation process, based on a rehabilitation plan, they became more engaged in their rehabilitation and gained a better understanding of their participation during the process. Knowledge of the differences in how clients use the rehabilitation plan during the rehabilitation process can support their active engagement during rehabilitation. This, in turn, can promote a more holistic view among clients and professionals during the rehabilitation for people with late effects of polio.

AB The drop in childhood vaccination cov-erage (VC), including poliomyelitis, has become a health concern. The objective was to analyze the temporal trend of coverage of the three doses of the polio vaccine in the first 12 months of life between 2011 and 2021, in addition to mapping vaccina-tion coverage in Brazil, including the COVID-19 pandemic period. An ecological study was carried out using interrupted time series (STI) techniques and spatial analysis, with data from the National Immunization Program Information System. The VC trend was adjusted by the Newey-West vari-ance estimator according to the federated units and the Brazilian Deprivation Index. The VC dis-tribution was estimated by Bayesian models and the spatial clusters by the global and local Moran index, identifying areas of lower coverage in the health regions. There was a reduction in the VC over the period in all regions, being more pro-nounced in the North and Northeast regions and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The biggest drops were identified in states and health regions with greater social vulnerability after 2019. The drop in VC shows that the risk of reintroduction of the wild virus is imminent and the challenges need to be faced with the strengthening of the Brazilian Health System (SUS).

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Background: Immunization is one of the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions. Most vaccines in the immunization schedule require two or more doses to trigger adequate immune response; appropriate timing, proper interval between vaccine doses, and completion of all vaccine doses are important to attain optimal protection.
   Objective: To evaluate and identify factors associated with the timeliness of vaccine doses; assess the interval between vaccine doses; and identify missed opportunities among children aged 12 to 23 months.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted that employed the 30 by 10 modified WHO immunization coverage cluster sampling technique. Considering pastoral and semi-pastoral areas, a total of 60 clusters with a sample of 600 children aged 12 to 23 months and mothers/caregivers were included. Data were collected using smartphones loaded with the Open Data Kit (ODK) system and exported to STATA 12.0 for data description and analysis.
   Results: The response rate was 97%, with 54.8% of the sample from pastoral areas. About 51% of the respondents were Muslim, 68% had no education, and 67% were aged 30 or above. More than one fifth (21.9%) of children received at least one vaccine dose earlier than the recommended minimum age. Nearly half (47.7%) of children received at least one subsequent dose earlier than an interval of four weeks. The overall rate of missed opportunities was 42.7%, which was higher in pastoral (61.4%) compared to semi-pastoral areas (30.9%) (P <0.001). Children from pastoral areas had a higher rate of missed opportunities compared to children from semipastoral areas (OR=4.05; 95% CI: 2.28-7.22); and children from mothers/caregivers aged 30 or above had a higher rate of missed opportunities than mothers aged <30 (OR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.32-3.13).
   Conclusions: The study identified high proportions of children who started vaccination earlier than the recommended age (later for the first dose of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV0)). In addition, multiple vaccine doses were administered before the minimum interval of four weeks. Children in pastoral areas have higher rate of missed opportunities compare to children in semi pastoralist and pastoralist areas for vaccines with same schedule.
   Recommendations: Strong interpersonal communication between mothers and vaccination providers is vital for the timely administration of vaccines. Emphasis should be placed on regular supervision and periodic in-service training of health workers to practice timely vaccine commencement, and maintain proper intervals between doses. Immunization service providers should give all the recommended vaccines with same schedule to reduce rate of missed opportunities.

TI METHODOLOGICAL AND CONCEPTUAL ISSUES IN MEASURING THE LONG-TERM IMPACT
   OF DISABILITY - THE EXPERIENCE OF POLIOMYELITIS PATIENTS IN MANITOBA
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is based on a Canadian study which is examining the long term impact of disability among people who developed respiratory or non-respiratory polio during the epidemics of 1950s and who were admitted to the same Manitoba hospital, the centralized treatment center for the Province. This research is exploring change in the lives of these individuals by focusing on 3 conceptually distinct, although empirically overlapping areas or dimensions. The 1st is called the trajectory of disability and refers to changes in functional status. The 2nd includes those changes which are the product of the interaction between the normal processes of aging and the long term impact of poliomyelitis. The 3rd is changes in the context of disability. This refers not only to changes in medical and technological knowledge, but sociopolitical developments including the emergence of a Disabled Rights Consumer Movement. This paper discusses the methodological and conceptual issues involved in the study, particularly its combination of different methods of data collection and the value of its historical-prospective design for capturing the effects of change over time in each of these different dimensions.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe functional performance in activities of daily living (ADL) and the use of technical aids among persons with late effects of polio.
   METHOD. Abilities in ADL of 150 participants 20 to 82 years of age were assessed with the Sunnaas Index of ADL, and the participants' use of technical aids was recorded.
   RESULTS. The activities in which most participants were independent were eating, daily hygiene, and communication. Wany needed technical aids, adaptation of their homes, or both to perform mobility-related activities and to dress or undress, take a bath or shower, cook, or manage toilet visits. In total, 86 (57%) used mobility aids such as canes, crutches, and walkers. Thirty-one (21%) used wheelchairs within or outside the home. Bath and shower aids were the most commonly used technical aids other than mobility aids. The activity where most participants depended on others was housework.
   CONCLUSION. In spite of their disabilities, most participants performed well in many ADL, functioning independently by using technical aids and by living in an adapted environment.

TI 30 years of polio campaigns in Ethiopia, India and Nigeria: the impacts
   of campaign design on vaccine hesitancy and health worker motivation

AB Introduction The debate over the impact of vertical programmes, including mass vaccination, on health systems is long-standing and often polarised. Studies have assessed the effects of a given vertical health programme on a health system separately from the goals of the vertical programme itself. Further, these health system effects are often categorised as either positive or negative. Yet health systems are in fact complex, dynamic and tightly linked. Relationships between elements of the system determine programme and system-level outcomes over time. Methods We constructed a causal loop diagram of the interactions between mass polio vaccination campaigns and government health systems in Ethiopia, India and Nigeria, working inductively from two qualitative datasets. The first dataset was 175 interviews conducted with policymakers, officials and frontline staff in these countries in 2011-2012. The second was 101 interviews conducted with similar groups in 2019, focusing on lessons learnt from polio eradication. Results Pursuing high coverage in polio campaigns, without considering the dynamic impacts of campaigns on health systems, cost campaign coverage gains over time in weaker health systems with many campaigns. Over time, the systems effects of frequent campaigns, delivered through parallel structures, led to a loss of frontline worker motivation, and an increase in vaccine hesitancy in recipient populations. Co-delivery of interventions helped to mitigate these negative effects. In stronger health systems with fewer campaigns, these issues did not arise. Conclusion It benefits vertical programmes to reduce the construction of parallel systems and pursue co-delivery of interventions where possible, and to consider the workflow of frontline staff. Ultimately, for health campaign designs to be effective, they must make sense for those delivering and receiving campaign interventions, and must take into account the complex, adaptive nature of the health systems in which they operate.

AB Background: Vaccination is an important tool for reducing infectious disease morbidity and mortality. In the past, less than 80% of children 12-23 months of age were fully immunized in Burkina Faso.
   Objectives: To describe coverage and assess factors associated with adherence to the vaccination schedule in rural area Burkina Faso.
   Methods: The study population was extracted from the Nouna Health and Demographic surveillance system cohort. Data from four rounds of interviews conducted between November 2012 and June 2014 were considered. This study included 4016 children aged 12-23 months. We assessed the effects of several background factors, including sex, factors reflecting access to health care (residence, place of birth), and maternal factors (age, education, marital status), on being fully immunized defined as having received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and oral polio vaccine, and measles vaccine by 12 months of age. The associations were studied using binomial regression to derive prevalence ratios (PRs) in univariate and multivariate regression models.
   Results: The full vaccination coverage increased significantly over time (72% in 2012, 79% in 2013, and 81% in 2014, p = 0.003), and the coverage was significantly lower in urban than in rural areas (PR 0.84; 0.80-0.89). Vaccination coverage was neither influenced by sex nor influenced by place of birth or by maternal factors.
   Conclusion: The study documented a further improvement in full vaccination coverage in Burkina Faso in recent years and better vaccination coverage in rural than in urban areas. The organization of healthcare systems with systematic outreach activities in the rural areas may explain the difference between rural and urban areas.

   Setting: Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University Hospital. Subjects: Thirty-two patients were divided into two groups for either hospital- or home-based aerobic exercise programme.
   Main outcome measures: Patients were assessed before and after the rehabilitation programme, with respect to functional capacity (pVo(2)) fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale) and quality of life (Nottingham Heath Profile).
   Results: After the exercise programme, improvement was observed in the hospital exercise group compared to a pre-exercise period in all Nottingham Heath Profile scores (except sleep scores), pVo(2), Fatigue Severity Scale and Fatigue Impact Scale (cognitive, physical, psychosocial, total) (P<0.05). In contrast, in the home exercise group a decrease was observed in pVo(2) scores after the rehabilitation programme, compared to a pre-rehabilitation period (P<0.05). In addition, a significant improvement was observed in the home exercise group after the rehabilitation programme in all parameters excluding Fatigue Impact Scale-physical, Fatigue Impact Scale-psychosocial, and Nottingham Heath Profile-sleep (P<0.05). When the two exercise groups were compared, improvement was observed in the hospital exercise group compared to the home exercise group in pVo(2) and Fatigue Severity Scale-total, Fatigue Impact Scale-physical, Fatigue Impact Scale-psychosocial, Fatigue Impact Scale-total, and Nottingham Heath Profile-energy scores (P<0.05).
   Conclusion: Fatigue and quality of life were both improved in the home and hospital exercise groups. An increase was also found in the functional capacity in the hospital exercise group. A regular exercise programme is beneficial to patients with post-polio syndrome.

TI Factor structure of the PANAS and the relationship between positive and

AB Aim. This study examined the psychometric properties of the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) in a post-polio sample and the relationship of these affect the dimensions.
   Method. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed with sample 1 (randomly selected from the total sample), to examine the underlying dimensions of the PANAS. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed with samples 2 and 1 to assess the fit of the models to the data. Model fit tests were based on the chi(2) likelihood ratio test, comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square estimate of approximation (RMSEA).
   Results. In the EFA phase, two factors were extracted and oblique rotation was applied to interpret pattern of loadings. In the CFA phase, both samples 1 and 2, model fit tests demonstrated that the models were unsatisfactory and indicated poor fit of the model to the observed data. Post-hoc model fitting of three error correlations as indicated by modification indices, proved a better fit for both samples.
   Conclusions. The results of the factor analyses suggested the possibility of a third dimension reflecting negative affect and that affect may consist of more than two general dimensions in the context of disability. In post-polio population, some of the symptoms of negative affect may be caused by physical symptoms that are related to the disability experience.

TI INSECTICIDAL COMPOUNDS - EFFECTS ON REPLICATION OF VACCINIA AND POLIO
   VIRUSES IN HUMAN CHANG-STRAIN LIVER CELLS
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Insecticidal compounds DDT, chlordane, dicofol, trichlorophon, malathion, and dinocap at subtoxic concentrations inhibited vaccinia virus replication in human Chang-strain liver cells. Under the same experimental conditions, the replication of poliovirus was inhibited only by chlordane and malathion, whereas dicofol and dinocap increased the virus yields 4 and 18 times, respectively, and DDT exhibited a light stimulatory effect. Since the reduction in virus yields was not due to extracellular inactivation of virus, some insecticides may exert an antiviral activity by altering some physiological activities of cells. Consequently, the magnitude of virus replication may be useful as a parameter for the detection of toxicity in insecticides and other chemicals below their acute toxicity levels.

AB Background Sabin inactivated and bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (sIPV, bOPV) were commonly used in China since 2016. We conducted an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 4 trial to assess immune persistence following sequential immunisation with sIPV or bOPV, and immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of poliovirus vaccine in children aged 4 years. Methods Participants from a previous clinical trial with three different sequential schedules with sIPV (I) or bOPV (B) at ages 2, 3, and 4 months (Groups I-B-B, I-I-B, I-I-I) in 2017 were followed-up. The children were further divided into five subgroups after sIPV was given for Group I-B-B, and sIPV or bOPV randomly given for Group I-I-B and Group I-I-I (128 children in Groups I-B-B-I, 60 in Group I-I-B-B, 64 in Group I-I-B-I, 68 in Group I-I-I-B, 67 in Group I-I-I-I). Immune persistence and immunogenicity were assessed by measuring poliovirus type-specific antibodies, and safety were analysed in all children who received the booster dose. Findings Between Dec 5, 2020 and Jun 30, 2021, we respectively enrolled 381 participants in the immune persistence analysis, and 352 participants in per protocol (PP) analysis of the immunogenicity of the booster immunisation. Seropositivity rates of antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 3 were all >90% four years after primary immunisation, while for poliovirus type 2 were 46.83%, 75.41%, and 90.23% (& chi;2 = 60.948, P < 0.001) for Groups I-B-B, I-I- B, and I-I-I, respectively. After the booster dose, seropositivity rates were 100% for all three serotypes in Group I-B- B-I, I-I-B-I and I-I-I-I; In Group I-I-B-B and I-I-I-B, the seropositivity rates for types 1 and 3 were all 100%, for type 2 were 92.59% and 98.46%. The geometric mean titres (GMTs) against poliovirus 1 and 3 were all high in five groups (>1860.73), and the GMTs against type 2 were significantly lower in groups booster with bOPV: Group I-I-B- B (50.60) and Group I-I-I-B (247.84). There was no significant difference in seropositivity rates or GMTs for all three serotypes (P > 0.05) between Group I-I-B-I and I-I-I-I. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Interpretation Our findings suggest that at least two sIPV doses are needed in the current routine poliovirus immunisation schedule, and schedules containing 3 or 4 doses of sIPV provide better protection against poliovirus type 2 than the current sIPV-sIPV-bOPV-bOPV schedule in China.

AB Background: Vaccines have substantially contributed to reducing morbidity and mortality among children, but inequality in coverage continues to persist. In this study, we aimed to examine inequalities in child vaccination coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data in 25 sub-Saharan African countries. We defined full vaccination coverage as a child who received one dose of bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), three doses of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine (DTP 3), three oral polio vaccine doses (OPV 3), and one dose of measles vaccine. We used the concentration index (CCI) to measure wealthrelated inequality in full vaccination, incomplete vaccination, and zero-dose children within and between countries. We fitted a multilevel regression model to identify predictors of inequality in receipts of full vaccination. Results: Overall, 56.5% (95% CI: 55.7% to 57.3%) of children received full vaccination, 35.1% (34.4% to 35.7%) had incomplete vaccination, while 8.4% (95% CI: 8.0% to 8.8%) of children remained unvaccinated. Full vaccination coverage across the 25 sub-Saharan African countries ranged from 24% in Guinea to 93% in Rwanda. We found pro-rich inequality in full vaccination coverage in 23 countries, except for Gambia and Namibia, where we found pro-poor vaccination coverage. Countries with lower vaccination coverage had higher inequalities suggesting pro-rich coverage, while inequality in unvaccinated children was disproportionately concentrated among disadvantaged subgroups. Four or more antenatal care contracts, childbirth at health facility, improved maternal education, higher household wealth, and frequently listening to the radio increased vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Continued efforts to improve access to vaccination services are required in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving vaccination coverage and reducing inequalities requires enhancing access to quality services that are accessible, affordable, and acceptable to all. Vaccination programs should target critical social determinants of health and address barriers to better maternal health-seeking behaviour. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Empirical evidence regarding the relationship between childhood immunization and individual- and community-level factors in low-income countries has received little attention. We compared the trends and the effects of a wide range of individual- and community-level socioeconomic factors on the likelihood of a child being immunized between 2004 and 2010 in Malawi.
   Methods: We used data from the 2004 and 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey and applied generalized estimating logistic regression equation to analyze data respectively on 2042 and 3496 children aged 12-23 months. We compared the relationship between individual- and community-level socioeconomic factors and a child's vaccination status for four basic vaccines recommended by the World Health Organization: bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT3) vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV3), and measles-containing vaccine 1 (MCV1).
   Results: The trends of vaccination had a similar pattern in 2004 and 2010. The coverage of the four vaccinations was highest for BCG and lowest for OPV3 and complete immunization was higher in 2010. The multivariate analyses show that mother's low education, having one or none antenatal visits, having no immunization card, having immunization card but not seen, residing in poor households, and living in central region were the most significant factors associated with decreased odds of achieving vaccination coverage and complete vaccination in both 2004 and 2010. However, maternal education was more likely to be associated with children's immunization in 2010, while the geographical region was more likely to be associated with children's immunization in 2004.
   Conclusions: There were marked improvements in the national immunization coverage from 2004 to 2010. In order to achieve complete immunization, to further enhance the national immunization coverage as well as to lessen the gaps and disparities in childhood vaccination in Malawi, policy makers should design interventions based on the factors addressed in this study.

AB Introduction Myanmar, a conflict-affected geographically and ethnically diverse lower middle-income country, was in the donor transition phase for health prior to the political unrest of the last year. This study analyses the distribution of benefit and utilisation of basic childhood vaccinations from the highly donor-dependent Expanded Program on Immunization for populations of different socioeconomic status (SES). Methods We conducted a benefit incidence analysis with decomposition analysis to assess the equity of benefit. We used basic childhood immunisations-BCG, measles, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT)/pentavalent, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and full vaccination-as measurements for healthcare use. Childhood immunisation data were collected from Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. Cost of vaccines was obtained from UNICEF document and 'Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue' and adjusted with regional cost variations. We reported Concentration Index (CI) and Achievement Index (AI) by SES, including wealth quintiles, maternal education and across geographic areas. Results Nationally, better-off households disproportionately used more services from the programme (CI-Wealth Index (CI-WI) for BCG, measles, DPT/pentavalent, OPV and full immunisation: 0.032, 0.051, 0.120, 0.091 and 0.137, respectively). Benefits had a pro-poor distribution for BCG but a less pro-rich distribution than utilisation for all other vaccines (CI-WI: -0.004, 0.019, 0.092, 0.045 and 0.106, respectively). Urban regions had a more pro-rich distribution of benefit than that in rural areas, where BCG and measles had a pro-poor distribution. Subnational analysis found significant heterogeneity: benefit was less equitably distributed, and AI was lower in conflict-affected states than in government-controlled areas. The major contributors to vaccine inequality were SES, antenatal care visits and paternal education. Conclusion Donors, national government and regional government should better plan to maintain vaccine coverage while improving equity of vaccine services, especially for children of lower SES, mothers with less antenatal care visits and lower paternal education living in conflicted-affected remote regions.

AB Background: Globally, non-attendance for immunization appointments remains a challenge to healthcare providers. A review of the 2011 immunization coverage for Kadoma City, Zimbabwe was 74% for Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), Pneumococcal and Pentavalent antigens. The immunization coverage was less than 90%, which is the target for Kadoma City. Adoption of short message services (SMS) reminders has been shown to enhance attendance in some medical settings. The study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of SMS reminders on immunization programme for Kadoma City.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Kadoma City clinics in Zimbabwe. Women who delivered and were residents of Kadoma City were recruited into the study. In the intervention group, SMS reminders were sent at 6, 10 and 14 weeks in addition to routine health education. In the non-intervention no SMS reminders were used, however routine health education was offered. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Epi Info 7 (TM), where frequencies, means, risk ratios and risk differences were generated.
   Results: A total of 304 participants were recruited, 152 for the intervention group and 152 for the non-intervention group. The immunization coverage at 6 weeks was 97% in the intervention group and 82% in the non-intervention group (p < 0.001). At 14 weeks immunization coverage was 95% for intervention and 75% for non-intervention group (p < 0.001). Those who did not delay receiving immunization at 14 weeks was 82% for the intervention and 8% for non-intervention group. Median delay for intervention was 0 days (Q(1) = 0; Q(3) = 0) and 10 days (Q(1) = 6; Q(3) = 17) for non-intervention group. The risk difference (RD) for those who received SMS reminders than those in the non intervention group was 16.3% (95% CI: 12.5-28.0) at 14 weeks.
   Conclusion: Immunization coverage in the intervention group was significantly higher than in non-intervention group. Overall increase in immunization coverage can be attributed to use of SMS.

TI A CONTINUING STUDY OF THE ACQUISITION OF NATURAL IMMUNITY TO
   POLIOMYELITIS IN REPRESENTATIVE LOUISIANA HOUSEHOLDS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1953, about 150 households from 3 areas in southern Louisiana were observed to determine when and under what circumstances sub-clinical immunizing infections with polio-viruses occur. Routine monthly stool and blood specimens have revealed 109 episodes of household infection. Infections, with the 3 virus types, occurred throughout the year, but with marked seasonal increase in late summer and fall. Infections were more frequent in Negroes than in whites, and in large family groups. Infection characteristically involved all non-immune members of the index family as well as closely associated families. In 1954, type 3 infections predominated, and in 1955 type 1 infections were more frequent, both "epidemics" apparently conditioned by specific deficiencies in immunity among children under 4 years of age.

AB The effect of severe disability, tracheostomy, and ventilator use on psychosocial functioning, gainful employment, life satisfaction, and perceived well-being were studied for a population of 395 ventilator assisted post-poliomyelitis individuals (PVAIs). Standard psychosocial survey instruments and other general questioning were used. Two-hundred-seventy-three physically intact health care professionals served as controls. They were surveyed about their own life satisfaction and perceived well-being and were asked to judge how severely disabled ventilator assisted individuals would respond to such questioning. The relative distress associated with ventilator use was also evaluated in a similar manner.
   Fifty six of 380 responding PVAIs (14.7%) expressed dissatisfaction with their lives in general. This compares with 8.5% of the controls and 7% of a previously studied general population. The controls significantly underestimated the patients' life satisfaction and well-being scores and significantly overestimated the relative hardship associated with ventilator use. The post-polio individuals using noninvasive methods of assisted ventilation were also significantly more satisfied with their lives than were those ventilated via tracheostomy. Fifty-seven of 148 (39%) individuals married and 165 of 395 (42%) individuals were gainfully employed during long-term ventilator use.
   We conclude that many severely disabled post-poliomyelitis ventilator users lead productive lives. The vast majority have a positive affect and are satisfied with life. Noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives may lend to greater life satisfaction for these individuals than ventilation delivered via an indwelling tracheostomy. Health care professionals may significantly underestimate their patients' satisfaction with life and this may have a bearing on patient management.

AB Background: A new 13-item rating scale, the Self-Reported Impairments in Persons with Late Effects of Polio (SIPP), has been developed. The SIPP has been analyzed using the Rasch method and has shown good construct validity and internal consistency. To establish its clinical utility, further evaluation of its psychometric properties is needed.
   Objective: To evaluate the test-retest reliability of the SIPP and to define limits for the smallest change that indicates a real change, both for a group of persons and a single individual.
   Design: A postal survey.
   Setting: University Hospital.
   Participants: Fifty-one persons (31 men and 20 women; mean age, 72 years) with clinically verified late effects of polio.
   Intervention: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measurements: The participants completed the SIPP twice, 2 weeks apart. The response frequencies at test occasion 1 (T1) and test occasion 2 (T2) were calculated. Test-retest reliability was analyzed using the percentage agreement of each item, the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the mean difference between the test occasions (C), together with the 95% confidence intervals for C, the standard error of measurement, the smallest real difference, and a Bland-Altman plot.
   Results: The percentage agreement (ie, the same scoring at both test occasions) was >70% for 10 of 13 items. The mean score (standard deviation) was 27.9 (5.7) points at T1 and 28.2 (6.0) points at T2, with no systematic difference between the test occasions. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.88, the standard error of measurement (the smallest change for a group of persons) was 2.0 points, and the smallest real difference (the smallest change for a single individual) was 5.6 points, respectively.
   Conclusion: The SIPP is a reliable rating scale in persons with late effects of polio and can be used to evaluate effects of rehabilitation interventions and changes of perceived impairments over time both for a group of persons and for a single individual.

TI Migrant health: the Apulian model
SO EPIDEMIOLOGIA & PREVENZIONE
LA English
DT Article
DE health surveillance; infectious diseases; syndromic surveillance
AB Introduction. Since the 1990s Puglia has been totally involved in the reception and assistance of refugees. The prevention of infectious diseases among migrants, especially those residing in communities, is an important concern for public health authorities, since infectious diseases eliminated in Europe may still be widespread in the migrants' countries of origin, and other diseases may have a higher incidence than in European countries. Thus immigrants may contribute to the burden and spread of infectious diseases.
   Objective. We describe the Apulian model of management and prevention of infectious disease among the population of Asylum Seeker Centres (CARA). It consists of a number of activities: surveillance of Poliovirus circulation, tuberculosis screening, seroprevalence studies of viral hepatitis and HIV, an immunization program for children, and syndromic surveillance. All the activities are organized and carried out by the Regional Observatory for Epidemiology among refugees hosted in the Bari Palese CARA.
   Results. Surveillance of Poliovirus circulation has been carried out periodically since 2008 by assessing the presence of wild poliovirus or Sabin-like poliovirus in stool samples and seroprevalence studies. Data did not show circulation of poliovirus and indicated a good level of immunization against polio among refugees. Seroprevalence studies of viral hepatitis and HIV were carried out in 2008 and involved 529 refugees; 44 individuals (8.3%) were HBsAg positive, 24 (4.5%) were anti-HCV positive, 8 (1.5%) were HIV positive. Tuberculosis screening started in 2009 after a refugee's death due to tuberculosis and has been ongoing since then. The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is used and cutipositive migrants are examined by chest X-ray. Around 50% of migrants have been found to be cutipositive and 10% showed TB sequelae. Syndromic surveillance and an immunization program began in 2011 because of the significant increase in migration flow following civil unrest in North Africa; respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea were the most frequent notified syndromes. The immunization program involved 129 children coming from 23 countries: all received the appropriate vaccinations. The program also includes an annual special session to vaccinate all refugees against flu.
   Conclusions. The results confirmed some traditional concerns about migrant health and especially about the control of infectious diseases among these populations and the need, from our point of view, to strengthen screening to aid the development of trust between migrants and resident population.

TI EFFECTS OF SOCIAL CLASS AND FRIENDS EXPECTATIONS ON ORAL POLIO
   VACCINATION PARTICIPATION
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Data obtained from a sample of mothers in a western state indicated that mothers from the lower socioeconomic class had their children immunized less frequently than did mothers from the middle and upper social classes. Lower social class mothers less frequently than middle and upper social class mothers reported that they believed their friends expected them to utilize available immunization services to protect their children against poliomyelitis. No significant differences existed between lower and upper class mothers with respect to immunization rates when the mothers with similar views concerning their friends'' expectations were compared separately. These findings suggest that lower social class persons tend to have lower Immunization rates because there are proportionately more people in the upper and middle social classes who believe their friends expect them to be immunized than there are in the lower socioeconomic class.

AB Sense of Coherence (SOC), comprising comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness, is important for the sense of living a good life with Late Effects of Polio (LEoP). However, there is a lack of knowledge about the meaning of these three components. The aim of this study was to explore in-depth the meaning of SOC among persons living with LEoP, in terms of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. A directed content analysis was performed based on individual interviews with 7 men and 7 women with LEoP (mean age 73 years). SOC in persons with LEoP existed in two overarching themes that were closely intertwined: a state of motion and a state of being. The state of motion comprised active approaches, choices and actions, and was a process aimed at achieving a stronger comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. The state of being comprised the comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness that the persons currently experienced. A profound understanding of SOC as both a state of motion and state being is essential for rehabilitation professionals when providing self-management support to persons living with LEoP. This understanding can increase their sense of living a good life and also be used in the rehabilitation of other life-long conditions.

AB Background: Due to intensified measles immunization efforts, measles mortality has decreased substantially worldwide, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated a 92% decrease in measles-related deaths in the WHO AFRO region for the period 2000-2008. Recently, the AFRO region established a measles pre-elimination goal and experts have suggested engaging in a measles eradication campaign at the global level. However, recent large-scale outbreaks in many Sub-Saharan African countries present a challenge to measles control efforts. This paper examines measles immunization and the impact of measles supplemental immunization activities (SlAs) on routine immunization coverage in South Africa (SA).
   Methods: We reported on immunization coverage trends in SA for the period 2001-2010 at the province and district levels. The data included routine immunization for 1st and 2nd doses of measles vaccine (MCV1, MCV2), SlAs, 1st dose of Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, 1st and 3rd doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV1, OPV3), 3rd dose of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis-Haemophilus-influenzae-B vaccine (DTP-Hib3), and the number of under-one-year-olds having completed a primary course of immunization (Imm1). A regression model looked at the SIA impact on routine coverage.
   Results: Over the past decade, MCV1 and MCV2 coverage have increased nationally from 68% and 57% in 2001 to 95% and 83% in 2010, respectively. SIA coverage has remained at high levels, around 90%, over the same period. Substantial heterogeneity in MCV1 and MCV2 coverage is present across SA districts, with differences in coverage of 56% (MCV1) and 51% (MCV2) in 2010. In any given year, occurrence of SlAs was associated with a decrease in routine immunization coverage of MCV1, MCV2, OPV1, OPV3, DTP-Hib3, and Imm1, at the district level.
   Conclusions: The heterogeneity in measles vaccination coverage across SA districts challenges the goal of measles elimination in SA and SSA. The reduction in routine immunization coverage associated with the occurrence of SlAs raises the legitimate concern that SlAs may negatively impact health systems' functioning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper highlights distinctive features of a neglected class of economic activity in the domain of medical innovation, namely the creation of testing regimes in clinical trials, asking how their nature might be expected to affect innovation of medical technology. It argues firstly that clinical trials are not simply about passively validating an already well-known technology and verifying its safety. Rather, clinical trials are part of a more active process of learning that allows pharmaceutical innovations to be useful outside the laboratory. It argues secondly that product development can proceed along a number of long and costly paths before a product's behaviour in actual practice becomes clear, which can make selecting between alternative courses of action difficult. Thus, product choice and product development need to go hand-in-hand. To consider these arguments, the paper maps out four trajectories of polio vaccine development, tracing their paths through clinical trials since the 1950s, and describes some of the defining features of testing regimes for medical innovation. These include institutions that integrate knowledge and co-ordinate skills in testing processes, and capabilities for allocating testing resources, managing testability constraints, sharing knowledge and improving commensurability between testing communities.

   on vaccination coverage estimates

AB Objective. We evaluated the accuracy of parental recall of children's immunization histories as compared with provider records and examined how errors in parental recall correlate with sociodemographic characteristics.
   Design. The validation study was part of a population-based household survey designed to assess immunization levels among Texas children under age 2 years. For 72% (n = 3278), interviewers used vaccination records from the parent to copy dates for the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP), oral polio vaccine (OPV), and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots. For parents without shot records (n = 1216), interviewers asked about each vaccine, whether the child had received the shot, how many, and at what age. Of these, 85% (n = 1029) were validated with health provider records.
   Results. Measured against provider records, only 34% of parents accurately recalled the number of DTP shots a child had. More often (42%) parents underestimated the number of DTF shots than overestimated (24%). Agreement between parental recall and provider records was high (83%) for the single dose of MMR. Accuracy of parents' recall did not differ by race/ethnicity, education level, or type of health insurance coverage, but decreased as child's age increased. Having a vaccination record at home was associated with a higher immunization status. Hispanic, lower educated, and uninsured parents were more likely to have a vaccination record than non-Hispanic, higher educated, and privately insured parents.
   Discussion. Validity of parental recall of children's immunization histories depends on the vaccine and the age of the child, which is highly correlated with the number of shots parents must recollect. Results suggest that inclusion of parent recall information from vaccination surveys underestimates DTP:OPV:MMR coverage. This underestimation is consistent across economic and race/ethnic groups. Thus, community surveys based on cards and recall should provide reliable conclusions about which groups need intensive program efforts. For the routine monitoring of vaccination coverage, reasonable estimates can be obtained by combining parent-held record and parent recall data. Caution is required when comparing coverage estimates from different surveys since the source of information and method of derivation will produce widely varying coverage rates.

AB BACKGROUND: People with late effects of polio (LEoP) may need rehabilitation to manage everyday life but knowledge of the benefits of interdisciplinary rehabilitation is limited.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in performance and satisfaction with performance of activities among people with LEoP following interdisciplinary rehabilitation.
   METHODS: Apre-post retrospective study based on data on 102 participants with LEoP from a rehabilitation clinic. Changes in performance and satisfaction with performance of daily activities before and after interdisciplinary rehabilitation were assessed with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).
   RESULTS: There were statistically significant increases in the mean performance and mean satisfaction with performance COPM scores from admission to discharge. Twenty-three percent and 19% of the participants, respectively, had improved their performance and satisfaction with performance, 25% and 26% of the participants had no changes, and 19% and 22% of the participants, respectively, rated their performance and satisfaction lower at discharge compared to admission.
   CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary rehabilitation can enhance self-rated performance and satisfaction with performance of daily activities among people with LEoP. Future studies of rehabilitation for people with LEoP should use a prospective design and capture the participants' process of change related to their rehabilitation period.

AB Background: Between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of children 12-23 months of age who received full immunization in Malawi decreased from 81% to 76%, prompting us to investigate the factors associated with completion of childhood immunization in Malawi.
   Methods: Using data from the 2015-16 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, generalized linear mixed models were applied on 3145 children 12-23 months of age nested within 850 communities. Complete immunization was defined as the child having received a Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, three doses of pentavalent vaccine, four doses of oral polio vaccine, three doses of pneumococcal vaccine, two doses of rotavirus vaccine and one dose of measles vaccine before their first birthday.
   Results: Adjusted multilevel regression showed that children born to mothers with either none or one antenatal care visit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.56 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.32 to 0.93]) and whose mothers had no card or no longer had a vaccination card (aOR 0.06 [95% CI 0.04 to 0.07]) were less likely to receive complete immunization. In addition, children from the poorest households (aOR 0.60 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.92]) and who resided in communities with a medium (aOR 0.73 [95% CI 0.53 to 0.98]) or high percentage (aOR 0.73 [95% CI 0.53 to 0.99]) of households that perceived the distance to the nearest health facility as a big problem had reduced odds of achieving complete immunization. Furthermore, the findings showed evidence of clustering effects of childhood complete immunization at the community level.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that a series of sociodemographic, health and contextual factors are associated with the completion of childhood vaccination. Therefore interventions that aim at increasing the completion of childhood immunization in Malawi should not only address individual needs, but should also consider contextual factors and the communities addressed in this study.

AB Background: New or increased impairments may develop several decades after an acute poliomyelitis infection. These new symptoms, commonly referred to as late effects of polio (LEoP), are characterised by muscular weakness and fatigue, generalised fatigue, pain at rest or during activities and cold intolerance. Growing older with LEoP may lead to increased activity limitations and participation restrictions, but there is limited knowledge of how these persons perceive the practical and psychological consequences of ageing with LEoP and what strategies they use in daily life. The aim of this qualitative study was therefore to explore how ageing people with LEoP perceive the their situation and what strategies they use for managing daily life.
   Methods: Seven women and seven men (mean age 70 years) were interviewed. They all had a confirmed history of acute poliomyelitis and new impairments after a stable period of at least 15 years. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using systematic text condensation.
   Results: The latent analysis resulted in three categories 'Various consequences of ageing with LEoP', 'Limitations in everyday activities and participation restrictions', and 'Strategies for managing daily life when ageing with LEoP' and 12 subcategories. The new impairments led to decreased physical and mental health. The participants perceived difficulties in performing everyday activities such as managing work, doing chores, partaking in recreational activities and participating in social events, thereby experiencing emotional and psychological distress. They managed to find strategies that mitigated their worries and upheld their self-confidence, for example finding practical solutions, making social comparisons, minimising, and avoidance.
   Conclusion: Ageing with LEoP affected daily life to a great extent. The participants experienced considerable impact of the new and increased impairments on their life situation. Consequently, their ability to participate in various social activities also became restricted. Social comparisons and practical solutions are strategies that facilitate adaptation and acceptance of the new situation due to LEoP. This emphasises the need to design rehabilitation interventions that focus on coping, empowerment and self-management for people ageing with LEoP.

TI Determinants of childhood immunisation coverage in urban poor
   settlements of Delhi, India: a cross-sectional study
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article

AB Objectives: Aggregate data on childhood immunisation from urban settings may not reflect the coverage among the urban poor. This study provides information on complete childhood immunisation coverage among the urban poor, and explores its household and neighbourhood-level determinants.
   Setting: Urban poor community in the Southeast district of Delhi, India.
   Participants: We randomly sampled 1849 children aged 1-3.5 years from 13 451 households in 39 clusters (cluster defined as area covered by a community health worker) in 2 large urban poor settlements. Of these, 1343 completed the survey. We collected information regarding childhood immunisation (BCG, oral polio vaccine, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, hepatitis B and measles) from vaccination cards or mothers' recall. We used random intercept logistic regression to explore the sociodemographic determinants of complete immunisation.
   Results: Complete immunisation coverage was 46.7% and 7.5% were not immunised. The odds of complete vaccination (OR, 95% CI) were lower in female children (0.70 (0.55 to 0.89)) and Muslim households (0.65 (0.45 to 0.94)). The odds of complete vaccination were higher if the mother was literate (1.6 (1.15 to 2.16)), if the child was born within the city (2.7 (1.97 to 3.65)), in a health facility (1.5 (1.19 to 2.02)), belonged to the highest wealth quintile (compared with the poorest; 2.46 (1.5 to 4.02)) or possessed a birth certificate (1.40 (1.03 to 1.91)). Cluster effect due to unmeasured neighbourhood factors expressed as median OR was 1.32.
   Conclusions: Immunisation coverage in this urban poor area was much lower than that of regional surveys reporting overall urban data. Socioeconomic status of the household, female illiteracy, health awareness and gender inequality were important determinants of coverage in this population. Hence, in addition to enhancing the infrastructure for providing mother and child services, efforts are also needed to address these issues in order to improve immunisation coverage in deprived urban communities.

AB The framework of the social structure of markets was used to analyze an online debate revolving around an emergency poliovirus vaccination campaign in Israel. Examination of a representative sample of 200 discussions revealed the activity of three parties: authoritative agents promoting vaccinations, alternative agents promoting anti-vaccination, both representing sellers, and the impartial agents, representing the customers-the general public deliberating whether to comply with vaccination or not. Both sellers interacted with consumers using mechanisms of luring and convincing. The authoritative agents conveyed their message by exhibiting professionalism, building trust and offering to share information. The alternative agents spread doubts and evoked negative emotions of distrust and fear. Among themselves, the alternative agents strived to discredit the authoritative agents, while the latter preferred to ignore the former. Content analysis of discussions conducted by the general public reveal reiteration of the messages conveyed by the sellers, implying that the transaction of pro and anti-vaccination ideas indeed took place. We suggest that the framework of the market as a social structure can be applied to the analysis of other vaccination debates, and thereby provide additional insights into vaccination polemics.

AB Introduction: India's childhood vaccination coverage has increased amid the implementation of national health policies intended to improve immunization levels. However, there is a dearth of contemporary studies comparing state-level childhood vaccination rates across India's highly diverse states and territories. This study assesses SES-based inequalities in childhood vaccination by state for 2002-2013.
   Methods: National surveys from 2002 to 2004, 2007 to 2008, and 2012 to 2013 were used for analyses. Household SES was assessed using an asset index created through principal component analysis. Full vaccination comprised 1 dose bacille Calmette-Guerin, 3 doses diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, 3 doses oral polio vaccine, and 1 dose measles-containing vaccine at age 12-60 months. Inequality analyses were stratified by 3 time periods and by government-designated high focus group versus non-high focus group states.
   Results: Childhood vaccination steadily increased between 2002 and 2013 in high focus group states but fell in some non-high focus group states, whereas SES-based vaccination inequalities generally decreased in both. In 2012-2013, rural areas had lower vaccination rates than urban areas in high focus group states but similar vaccination rates as urban areas in non-high focus group states. Increases in vaccination rates were not consistently accompanied by improvements in SES-based inequalities in vaccination.
   Conclusions: Childhood vaccination in India has improved overall, although increases are more pronounced in high focus group states than in non-high focus group states over the study period. The gap in coverage between these states decreased over time owing in part to the latter experiencing reductions in full vaccination rates during 2007-2013. SES-based vaccination disparities persist in India, highlighting the need to improve vaccination rates for all children, especially those from disadvantaged and underserved groups.

TI Effectiveness of Multiple-Strategy Community Intervention in Reducing
   Geographical, Socioeconomic and Gender Based Inequalities in Maternal
   and Child Health Outcomes in Haryana, India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIORITY
AB Objective
   The implemented multiple-strategy community intervention National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) between 2005 and 2012 aimed to reduce maternal and child health (MCH) inequalities across geographical, socioeconomic and gender categories in India. The objective of this study is to quantify the extent of reduction in these inequalities pre- and post-NRHM in Haryana, North India.
   Methods
   Data of district-level household surveys (DLHS) held before (2002-04), during (2007-08), and after (2012-13) the implementation of NRHM has been used. Geographical, socioeconomic and gender inequalities in maternal and child health were assessed by estimating the absolute differences in MCH indicators between urban and rural areas, between the most advantaged and least advantaged socioeconomic groups and between male and female children. Logistic regression analyses were done to observe significant differences in these inequalities between 2005 and 2012.
   Results
   There were significant improvements in all MCH indicators (p<0.05). The geographical and socioeconomic differences between urban and rural areas, and between rich and poor were significantly (p<0.05) reduced for pregnant women who had an institutional delivery (geographical difference declining from 22% to 7.6%; socioeconomic from 48.2% to 13%), post-natal care within 2 weeks of delivery (2.8% to 1.5%; 30.3% to 7%); and for children with full vaccination (10% to 3.5%, 48.3% to 14%) and who received oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diarrhea (11% to -2.2%; 41% to 5%). Inequalities between male and female children were significantly (p<0.05) reversed for full immunization (5.7% to -0.6%) and BCG immunization (1.9 to -0.9 points), and a significant (p<0.05) decrease was observed for oral polio vaccine (4.0% to 0%) and measles vaccine (4.2% to 0.1%).
   Conclusions
   The implemented multiple-strategy community intervention National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) between 2005 and 2012 might have resulted in significant reductions in geographical, socioeconomic and gender inequalities in MCH in Haryana, as causal relationships cannot be established with descriptive research.

AB On the basis of a wide range of historical sources, including published scientific literature and both public and private archives (Institut Merieux, WHO and IMTSSA), this article examines the history of the Brazilian vaccination campaign against cerebrospinal meningitis between 1974 and 1975. It explores not only certain aspects of vaccine production but also the wider social aspects of the ongoing project. Thus, it shows how the different actors were mobilised and their work coordinated in order to produce and vaccinate a whole country or more specifically, 90 million Brazilians in less than a year. This episode not only adds to the scholarship on the politics of vaccination but also attests to the complex reality of the production and use of a vaccine in the context of a public health emergency.

AB Simple Summary: People with post-polio syndrome (PPS) suffer frequent falls due to muscle weakness and problems with their balance. In order for a rehabilitation clinician to fit the patient with the optimal treatment plan to prevent imbalance and falls, we performed a simple 10-min walking test with 50 PPS patients. We also asked the patients how many falls they had experienced in the last year and they filled out a questionnaire regarding their balance confidence. We found that we can predict the occurrence of falls in PPS patients based on the consistency of their walking pattern. Since it is very easy to measure the walking pattern, our results may help rehabilitation clinicians to identify individuals at risk of fall and reduce the occurrence of falls in this population.Individuals with post-polio syndrome (PPS) suffer from falls and secondary damage. Aim: To (i) analyze the correlation between spatio-temporal gait data and fall measures (fear and frequency of falls) and to (ii) test whether the gait parameters are predictors of fall measures in PPS patients. Methods: Spatio-temporal gait data of 50 individuals with PPS (25 males; age 65.9 & PLUSMN; 8.0) were acquired during gait and while performing the Timed Up-and-Go test. Subjects filled the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC Scale) and reported number of falls during the past year. Results: ABC scores and number of falls correlated with the Timed Up-and-Go, and gait cadence and velocity. The number of falls also correlated with the swing duration symmetry index and the step length variability. Four gait variability parameters explained 33.2% of the variance of the report of falls (p = 0.006). The gait velocity was the best predictor of the ABC score and explained 24.8% of its variance (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Gait variability, easily measured by wearables or pressure-sensing mats, is an important predictor of falls in PPS population. Therefore, gait variability might be an efficient tool before devising a patient-specific fall prevention program for the PPS patient.

AB Background: The condensed 3-level version of the self-reported ambulation classification by Perry is a validated, simple-to-use instrument in clinical practice to classify functional ambulation.
   Objective: To further validate the clinical meaning of the classification for polio survivors, we compared physical mobility status across 3 functional ambulation categories and investigated the relation between physical mobility and functional ambulation category.
   Methods: We investigated a convenience sample of 140 individuals with polio [mean (SD) age 59.4 (12.1) years; 74 men] who were able to walk at least indoors. For indicators of physical mobility status, we assessed the walked distance (m) and walking energy cost (Jkg(-1)m(-1)) during a 6-min walk test at a comfortable speed. Furthermore, self-reported physical functioning and fatigue were assessed with the 36-item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning scale (SF36-PF) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. Self-reported functional ambulation was classified as household walker, limited community walker or full community walker.
   Results: The mean (SD) walked distance, energy cost, and SF36-PF and FSS scores significantly differed between household walkers (n = 48) and limited community walkers (n = 63) [275 (67) m; 6.35 (1.80) Jkg(-1)m(-1); 27.7 (13.5), 5.53 (1.06), respectively, and 323 (73) m; 5.49 (1.50) Jkg(-1) m(-1); 40.1 (15.1); 4.81 (1.38) (P < 0.018)] and full community walkers (n = 29) [383 (66) m; 4.68 (0.85) Jkg(-1)m(-1); 63.9 (18.5), 3.85 (1.54) (P < 0.001)], with significant differences also present between limited and full community walkers (P < 0.05). Walked distance and SF36-PF score were significantly associated with functional ambulation level, determining 46% of the variance in ambulation level.
   Conclusion: The simple, self-reported classification of functional ambulation in 3 levels is clinically meaningful for polio survivors because it consistently corresponds to differences in objective and self-reported indicators of physical mobility and, as such, can be used to better manage rehabilitation treatment.

AB Reduced walking ability is common in persons with late effects of polio (LEoP). Here, we explored how many walking limitations persons with LEoP perceive, and how these limitations influence daily life, by using a mixed-methods design. Fourteen persons (mean age 70 years, whereof 7 women) with LEoP responded to the Walking Impact Scale (Walk-12), and were interviewed individually. Qualitative data were analysed by systematic text condensation, and each quotation was deductively analysed in relation to the items in Walk-12. Running was perceived as most limited, whereas walking indoors without using support was perceived as least limited. A majority (>70%) were moderately to extremely limited in standing or walking, in walking speed and distance, which affected concentration and effort, as well as gait quality aspects. The limited walking ability intruded on many everyday activities, both indoors and outdoors, which affected social participation negatively. To increase safety when walking and reduce the fall risk, various strategies were adopted such as using aids, walking carefully, and avoiding risky activities. In conclusion, LEoP-related walking limitations influence participants' activity and participation greatly. By using both the Walk-12 scale and face-to-face interviews, an increased understanding of how walking limitations influence everyday life was achieved.

AB Background and objective: In this work, a mathematical model based on differential equations is proposed to describe the propagation of polio in a human population. The motivating system is a compartmental nonlinear model which is based on the use of ordinary differential equations and four compartments, namely, susceptible, exposed, infected and vaccinated individuals. Methods: In this manuscript, the mathematical model is extended in order to account for spatial diffusion in one dimension. Nonnegative initial conditions are used, and we impose homogeneous Neumann conditions at the boundary. We determine analytically the disease-free and the endemic equilibria of the system along with the basic reproductive number. Results: We establish thoroughly the nonnegativity and the boundedness of the solutions of this problem, and the stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions is carried out rigorously. In order to confirm the validity of these results, we propose an implicit and linear finite-difference method to approximate the solutions of the continuous model. Conclusions: The numerical model is stable in the sense of von Neumann, it yields consistent approximations to the exact solutions of the differential problem, and that it is capable of preserving unconditionally the positivity of the approximations. For illustration purposes, we provide some computer simulations that confirm some theoretical results derived in the present manuscript.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Individuals with late effects of poliomyelitis (LEoP) cope with various physical and psychological symptoms throughout their entire life which become more severe as they are ageing. Objectives: To perform a 10-year follow-up of the functional status and levels of psychological health of individuals with LEoP and to examine the associations of hope levels, work status, health perceptions, and life satisfaction with functional and psychological changes. Design: A within-subject 10-year follow-up study. Participants: Eighty-two individuals with LEoP who participated in a previous study 10 years ago. Methods: Outcome measures included the functional status of individuals with LEoP assessed by the activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaire, emotional distress based on the Global Health Questionnaire (GHQ), hope based on the Hope Scale, life satisfaction as measured by the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and subjective health perception. The McNemar test, paired t-test, Spearman's correlation coefficient, and linear regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age was 66.9 +/- 8.5 years with a male-female ratio of 0.52. A significant functional deterioration was noticed during the follow-up years. Yet, the functional deterioration was not associated with changes in psychological health. Psychological health was associated with elevated levels of hope and life satisfaction. Individuals with LEoP who continued to work demonstrated higher psychological health, higher levels of hope, and greater life satisfaction. Conclusions: Individuals with LEoP demonstrated significant psychological health, manifested in their ability to block emotional distress and maintain life satisfaction despite the deterioration in their functional status. Hope and psychological health were associated with increased life satisfaction. Work appeared to be a significant source of psychological health in this population.

AB How do global disease control priorities emerge? This paper examines the post-World War II histories of efforts to control three diseases - polio, malaria and tuberculosis - to investigate this issue. The paper draws from the policy studies literature to evaluate three models of the priority generation process. A rational model suggests logical selection based on global burden and the availability of cost-effective interventions. An incremental model suggests a drawn out process in which health priorities emerge gradually and interventions reach affected populations through slow diffusion. A punctuated equilibrium model suggests a more complex pattern: long periods of stability during which interventions are available only to select populations, punctuated by bursts of attention as these interventions spread across the globe in concentrated periods of time.
   The paper finds that the punctuated equilibrium model corresponds most closely to efforts to control these three diseases. Bursts are associated with the convergence of three conditions: the widespread acceptance of the disease as a threat; a perception that human interventions can control disease transmission; and the formation of a transnational coalition of health actors concerned with fighting the disease. The generation of each condition requires considerable groundwork, the reason for long periods of stability. Initiatives take off rapidly when the conditions couple, the reason for bursts. The paper aims to spark additional research on the subject of global disease control agenda setting, a neglected issue in the health policy literature.

AB Background: Although it is widely acknowledged that areas of conflict are associated with a high health burden, from a geospatial perspective it is difficult to establish these patterns at fine scales because of a lack of data. The release of the "WikiLeaks" Afghan War Diary (AWD) provides an interesting opportunity to advance analysis and theory into this interrelationship.
   Methods: This paper will apply two different space time analyses to identify patterns of improvised explosive devices (IED) detonations for the period of 2004 to 2009 in Afghanistan.
   Results: There is considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in IED explosions, with concentrations often following transportation links. The results are framed in terms of a resource for subsequent analyses to other existing health research in Afghanistan. To facilitate this, in our discussion we present a Google Earth file of overlapping rates that can be distributed to any researcher interested in combining his/her fine scale health data with a similarly granular layer of violence.
   Conclusion: The release of the AWD presents a previously unavailable opportunity to consider how spatially detailed data about violence can be incorporated into understanding, and predicting, health related spillover effects. The AWD can enrich previous research conducted on Afghanistan, and provide a justification for future "official" data sharing at appropriately fine scales.

AB The problems. problem-focused coping and satisfaction with activities of daily living in a total of 119 persons with muscular weakness are described. The study encompasses three groups: 33 persons with various types of muscular dystrophy, 46 with myotonic dystrophy and 40 with symptoms relating to the post-polio syndrome. A self-report instrument for Assessment of Problem-focused Coping (APC) was used. Most of the problems reported were connected with mobility and transportation and work, but the subjects used problem-focused coping relatively infrequently and few differences were found between the different groups or between the sexes. The most widely used problem-focused coping strategy was 'Devices and tricks'. The highest degree of satisfaction was noted For personal care and the lowest for mobility and transportation. The APC provides information about patients' evaluation of everyday situations. forming a complement to functional measurements in the field of rehabilitation.

AB This article presents a notional scheme of global surveillance and response to infectious disease outbreaks and reviews 14 international surveillance and response programs. In combination, the scheme and the programs illustrate how, in an ideal world and in the real world, infectious disease outbreaks of public health significance could be detected and contained. Notable practices and achievements of the programs are cited; these may be useful when instituting new programs or redesigning existing ones. Insufficiencies are identified in four critical areas: health infrastructure; scientific methods and concepts of operation; essential human, technical, and financial resources; and international policies. These insufficiencies challenge global surveillance of and response to infectious disease outbreaks of international importance. This article is intended to help policymakers appreciate the complexity of the problem and assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of proposed solutions. An assessment of the potential contribution of appropriate diagnostic tests to surveillance and response is included.

AB Immunisation is potentially the most effective and efficient of all preventive medical activities. It is also unique among interventions in that it protects both the individual and the community. The UK's immunisation programme has been highly successful in controlling a number of life threatening infectious diseases, and consequently public concern has shifted from the diseases to vaccine safety. In recent years a series of vaccine myths and vaccine safety scares have affected the UK and other industrialised countries. Although an effective vaccine without any risk is probably unachievable, the vaccines in use in the UK are very safe. Serious adverse outcomes truly attributable to vaccination are extremely rare, always far rarer than adverse outcomes among individuals acquiring the vaccines' target infections. Vaccine safety may be called into question, however, on the basis of spurious coincidental associations between vaccination and adverse events. An inadequate public health response in the 1970s to a scare over whooping cough vaccine allowed substantial losses of professional and public confidence to take place. Vaccine coverage halved and much preventable morbidity and mortality resulted. Plausible vaccine associations must be investigated thoroughly, and the UK has become a world leader in developing techniques for rapid investigations. The public health response to scares over MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine safety has been faster and firmer than for whooping cough and no link has been found between MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel disease or autism. Consequently the impact on immunisation coverage has been small, though the cumulative threat of measles, mumps, and rubella epidemics is growing. Recently an international investigation excluded a possible association of intussusception with oral polio vaccine before it could become a vaccine scare. A clearer chain of communication in responding to vaccine myths and scares is needed. This must provide rapid information and, if appropriate, reassurance to professionals and the public. Considerably more training is needed for professionals in providing information to the public and supporting parents in making difficult decisions over vaccination. Though there is no place for complacency, and improvements are needed, the UK's ability to monitor vaccine effectiveness, safety, and risks is strong, As a consequence it has a vaccination programme that is very safe and very effective.

TI Fatigue and Fear with Shifting Polio Eradication Strategies in India: A
   Study of Social Resistance to Vaccination
SO PLOS ONE

ID HIGH-RISK DISTRICTS; PARALYTIC POLIO; ENDGAME
AB Shifting polio eradication strategies may have generated fear and "resistance" to the eradication program in Aligarh, India during the summer of 2009. Participant observation and formal interviews with 107 people from May to August 2009 indicated that the intensified frequency of vaccination was correlated with patients' doubt in the efficacy of the vaccine. This doubt was exacerbated in a few cases as families were uninformed of the use of monovalent mOPV1, while P3 cases continued to occur. Many families had also come to believe that their children had been adversely affected by OPV after being told the vaccine carried no risk. Though polio is now largely eradicated in India, with only a single case in 2011, greater transparency about changes with vaccination policy may need to be considered to build trust with the public in future eradication programs.

AB Background There have been dozens of strikes by health workers in Kenya in the past decade, but there are few studies of their impact on maternal and child health services and outcomes. We conducted a retrospective survey study to assess the impact of nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 on utilization of maternal and child health services in western Kenya. Methods We utilized a parent study to enroll women who were pregnant in 2017 when there were prolonged strikes by health workers ("strike group") and women who were pregnant in 2018 when there were no major strikes ("control group"). Trained research assistants administered a close-ended survey to retrospectively collect demographic and pregnancy-related health utilization and outcomes data. Data were collected between March and July 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were antenatal care (ANC) visits, delivery location, and early child immunizations. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate risk ratios between the strike and control groups, adjusting for socioeconomic status, health insurance status, and clustering. Adjusted risk ratios (ARR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results Of 1341 women recruited in the parent study in 2017 (strike group), we re-consented 843 women (63%) to participate. Of 924 women recruited in the control arm of the parent study in 2018 (control group), we re-consented 728 women (79%). Women in the strike group were 17% less likely to attend at least four ANC visits during their pregnancy (ARR 0.83, 95%CI 0.74, 0.94) and 16% less likely to deliver in a health facility (ARR 0.84, 95%CI 0.76, 0.92) compared to women in the control group. Whether a child received their first oral polio vaccine did not differ significantly between groups, but children of women in the strike group received their vaccine significantly longer after birth (13 days versus 7 days, p = 0.002). Conclusion We found that women who were pregnant during nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 were less likely to receive WHO-recommended maternal child health services. Strategies to maintain these services during strikes are urgently needed.

   REASONS
AB Objectives
   This study used a health belief theory derived framework and structural equation model to examine moderators, mediators, and direct and indirect predictors of childhood vaccination.
   Methods
   A secondary analysis was conducted using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1599 parents living in urban and rural areas of Mysore district, India. Applying two-stage probability proportionate-to-size sampling, adolescent girls attending 7th through 10th grades in 23 schools were selected to take home a questionnaire to be answered by their parents to primarily assess HPV vaccine intentions. Parents were also asked whether their children had received one dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin; three doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus; three doses of oral Polio vaccine; and one dose of Measles vaccine. In addition, parents were asked about their attitudes towards childhood vaccination.
   Results
   Out of the 1599 parents, 52.2% reported that their children had received all the routine vaccines (fully vaccinated); 42.7% reported their children had missed at least one routine vaccine, and 5.2% reported that their children had missed all routine vaccinations. Perceptions about the benefits/facilitators to childhood vaccination significantly predicted the full vaccination rate (standardized regression coefficient (beta) = 0.29) directly and mediated the effect of parental education (beta = 0.11) and employment (beta = -0.06) on the rate of full vaccination. Parental education was significantly associated indirectly with higher rates of full vaccination (beta = 0.11). Parental employment was significantly associated indirectly with decreasing rates of full vaccination (beta = -0.05). Area of residence moderated the role of religion (beta = 0.24) and the `number of children' in a family (beta = 0.33) on parental perceptions about barriers to childhood vaccination. The model to data fit was acceptable (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.02, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.023; Comparative Fit Index = 0.92; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.91).
   Conclusions
   Full vaccination rate was relatively low among children in Mysore, especially among parents who were unsure about the benefits of routine vaccination and those with low educational levels. Interventions increasing awareness of the benefits of childhood vaccination that target rural parents with lower levels of education may help increase the rate of full childhood vaccination in India.

TI Coverage and factors associated with full immunisation among children
   aged 12-59 months in Bangladesh: insights from the nationwide
   cross-sectional demographic and health survey
SO BMJ OPEN

ID CHILDHOOD VACCINATION; PROGRAM; MEASLES; IMPACT
AB Objective To estimate the coverage and factors associated with full immunisation coverage among children aged 12-59 months in Bangladesh.
   Study design The study is cross sectional in design. Secondary dataset from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey was used for this analysis. Immunisation status was categorised as 'fully immunised' if the children had received all the eight recommended vaccine doses otherwise 'partially/unimmunised'.
   Settings Bangladesh.
   Participant Children aged 12-59 months were the study participants. Participants were randomly selected through a two-stage stratified sampling design. A total of 6230 children were eligible for the analysis.
   Results About 86% of the children (5356 out of 6230) were fully immunised. BCG has the highest coverage rate (97.1%) followed by oral polio vaccine 1 (97%) and pentavalent 1 (96.6%), where the coverage rate was the lowest for measles vaccine (88%). Coverage was higher in urban areas (88.5%) when compared with rural ones (85.1%). Full immunisation coverage was significantly higher among children who lived in the Rangpur division (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.46; 95% CI 2.45 to 4.88, p<0.001), were 48-59 months old (AOR=1.32; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64, p=0.013), lived in a medium size family (AOR=1.56; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86, p<0.001), had parents with a higher level of education (AOR=1.96; 95% CI 1.21 to 3.17, p=0.006 and AOR=1.55; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.29, p=0.026) and belonged to the richest families (AOR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.21, p<0.001). The likelihood of being partially or unimmunised was higher among children who had the father as their sole healthcare decision-maker (AOR=0.69; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92, p<0.012).
   Conclusions There were significant variations of child immunisation coverage across socioeconomic and demographic factors. These findings will inform innovative approaches for immunisation programmes, and the introduction of relevant policies, including regular monitoring and evaluation of immunisation coverage-particularly for low-performing regions, so that the broader benefit of immunisation programmes can be achieved in all strata of the society.

TI THE SPREAD OF LIVING ATTENUATED STRAINS OF POLIOVIRUSES IN 2 COMMUNITIES
   IN SOUTHERN LOUISIANA
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Living, attenuated polio-virus type 3 (Sabin vaccine) was administered orally early in June to all children in a group of families in 2 lower economic Negro communities in southern Louisiana which prior serologic study had been shown to lack widespread natural immunity to this virus type. At the same time, in a group of similar control families a placebo material was fed. Study of frequent, routine fecal specimens from all children served to indicate primary and contact infections. Excretion of homologous virus occurred in 90% of vaccine-fed children, and in 39% of contact children during the succeeding 7 weeks. Many concurrent "wild" enterovirus infections were detected. The failure of the vaccine strain to infect a larger proportion of the contact children was attributed in part to viral interference and in larger part to a lower infectiousness of the vaccine strain as compared with "wild" polioviruses. No illness of any sort could be associated with primary or contact poliovirus infection.

TI Eradication versus control for poliomyelitis: an economic analysis
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID VACCINE-DERIVED POLIOVIRUSES; POLIO ERADICATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; OPV
   CESSATION; DISEASE; WILD; CONTAINMENT; OUTBREAKS
AB Background Worldwide eradication of wild polioviruses is likely to yield substantial health and financial benefits, provided we finish the job. Challenges in the four endemic areas combined with continuing demands for financial resources for eradication have led some to question the goal of eradication and to suggest switching to a policy of control. Methods We developed a dynamic model, based on modelling of the currently endemic areas in India, to show the importance of maintaining and increasing the immunisation intensity to complete eradication and to illustrate how policies based on perception about high short-term costs or cost-effectiveness ratios without consideration of long-term benefits could undermine any eradication effort. An extended model assesses the economic implications and disease burden of a change in policy from eradication to control. Findings Our results suggest that the intensity of immunisation must be increased to achieve eradication, and that even small decreases in intensity could lead to large outbreaks. This finding implies the need to pay even higher short-run costs than are currently being spent, which will further exacerbate concerns about continued investment in interventions with high perceived cost-effectiveness ratios. We show that a wavering commitment leads to a failure to eradicate, greater cumulative costs, and a much larger number of cases. We further show that as long as it is technically achievable, eradication offers both lower cumulative costs and cases than control, even with the costs of achieving eradication exceeding several billion dollars more. A low-cost control policy that relies only on routine immunisation for 20 years with discounted costs of more than $3500 million could lead to roughly 200000 expected paralytic poliomyelitis cases every year in low-income countries, whereas a low-case control policy that keeps the number of cases at about 1500 per year could cost around $10000 million discounted over the 20 years. Interpretation Focusing on the large costs for poliomyelitis eradication, without assessing the even larger potential benefits of eradication and the enormous long-term costs of effective control, might inappropriately affect commitments to the goal of eradication, and thus debate should include careful consideration of the options.

AB In a health emergency, governments rely on public trust in their policy, and anticipate its compliance to protect health and save lives. Vaccine hesitancy compromises this process when an emergency involves infections. The prevailing discourse on vaccine hesitancy often describes it as a static phenomenon, ignoring its expanse and complexity, and neglecting the exploration of tools to address it. This article diverges from the conventional perspective by explaining the case of Pakistan and its communication strategy for the COVID-19 vaccine. Decades of polio vaccine hesitancy, rooted in the country's fight against terrorism, constitute its history. On the other hand, the first-ever launch of typhoid conjugate vaccine involving 35 million kids during 2019-2021 was a success. Against this backdrop, the country considered vaccine hesitancy as a dynamic phenomenon, interwoven with the social ecology and the responsiveness of the healthcare system. Its communication strategy facilitated those willing to receive the vaccine, while being responsive to the information needs of those still in the decision-making process. In the face of both hesitancy and a scarcity of vaccine doses, the country successfully inoculated nearly 70% (160 million) of its population in just over 1 year. People's perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine also improved over time. This achievement offers valuable insights and tools for policymakers and strategists focused on the demand side of vaccine programmes. The lessons can significantly contribute to the global discourse on improving vaccine confidence and bolstering global health security.

AB Background: Many persons affected with poliomyelitis develop post-polio syndrome (PPS) later in their life. Recently, the effectiveness of Exercise Therapy (ET) and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for PPS has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, but did not show a decrease in fatigue or improvement in secondary endpoints like Quality of Life and self-perceived activity limitations. The aim of this explorative study was to gain insight in the perceived effects and experiences of the interventions from the perspectives of the patients and therapists.
   Methods: Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 17 patients and 7 therapists. All participants were involved in the trial. A thematic analysis of the data was performed.
   Results: Some patients experienced a short term enhanced endurance and a better use of energy during the day. However, in general patients did not experience a long lasting reduction of fatigue from the CBT or ET. Mainly patients of the CBT, but also some patients of the ET described an increase of self-esteem and self-acceptance. As a result, patients were sometimes better able to perform physical activities during the day. In contrast to the CBT, the ET was in general perceived by the patients as an intensive therapy, which was difficult to fit into their daily routine. Therapists of both the CBT and the ET struggled with a low intrinsic motivation of the patients in the study. This made it sometimes difficult for the therapists to follow the protocol.
   Conclusion: Confirming the negative quantitative study outcome, the qualitative results did not demonstrate lasting effects on fatigue. Patients did, however, experience some benefits on self-esteem and acceptance of the disease. This study showed that it is of great importance to work with feasible interventions; they should fit the patients' needs on a practical (fit into their daily routine) and mental (fit their need for support) level.

TI Shorter Telomeres Among Individuals With Physical Disability: The

AB Objectives: Evidence suggests that individuals with physical disability may suffer from psychological distress and accelerated cellular aging, manifested by shortened telomere length (TL), compared with healthy individuals. Studies indicate that high levels of perceived stress and depression may increase the physiological susceptibility and, thus, may contribute to a short TL. However, the moderating role of perceived stress and depression within the relationship between physical disability and TL remains unknown.
   Method: The participants consisted of 119 male subjects (mean age 54.36 years, range 35-70). Of them, 30 were able-bodied and 89 had a physical disability: 34 were due to poliomyelitis (polio) and 55 were due to spinal cord injury. Blood samples for TL analysis were collected; the participants completed questionnaires and underwent disability evaluation.
   Results: Participants with disability had a shorter TL as well as elevated levels of perceived stress and depression compared with able-bodied controls. Both the perceived stress and depression were correlated with a shorter TL. Nonetheless, perceived stress, rather than depression, moderated the relationship between disability and IL; among participants with higher perceived stress levels, in particular, individuals with physical disability had a shorter TL than the able-bodied controls.
   Discussion: The present findings suggest that individuals with physical disability and who exhibit high levels of perceived stress may be particularly vulnerable for accelerated cellular aging, suggesting that perceived stress can be used as a valuable target for intervention.

AB Objective: To establish the validity of 2 objective measures of disability based on 2 self-reports in individuals with the late sequelae of poliomyelitis (LSP).
   Design: Nonexperimental research design.
   Setting: Regional ambulatory clinic specializing in the management of patients with LSP.
   Participants: Seventeen community dwellers with LSP
   Intervention: Completion of 2 exercise tests: the 6-minute walk (6-MW) test and a steady-rate walking test to calculate the cardiorespiratory conditioning index (CRCI), and 2 health status questionnaires: the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36).
   Main Outcome Measures: 6-MW distance and the CRCI, and scores from the physical dimensions of the SLP and the SF-36.
   Results: The 6-MW distance correlated significantly with the physical dimension scores of both the SIP (r = -.57, p < .05) and the SF-36 (r = .67, p < .05). Significant correlations were also observed between the CRCI and the physical dimension scores of the SIP (r = -.51, p < .05) and the SF-36 (r = .70, p < .01). The 2 objective measures correlated significantly with each other (r = .51, p < .05) as did the 2 physical dimension scores of the SIP and the SF-36 (r = -.80, p < .01).
   Conclusions: Although objective measures of disability corroborated self-reports of patients with LSP and, thus, supported their validity, each measure has a distinct role in clinical decision making.

AB Objective: To describe the underlying dimensions for a range of functional measures across 3 neurologic diseases at different time points.
   Design: Multiple cohort study.
   Setting: Combination of public hospital wards and community.
   Participants: Patients (N = 308) from 3 cohorts: paralytic poliomyelitis (n = 38), mean of 25 years previously, assessed once; acute stroke admitted to hospital and followed up for 12 months postdischarge (n = 181); and traumatic brain injury (TBI), admitted to hospital and followed up for 12 months postdischarge (n = 89).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: The Barthel Index, FIM instrument, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), and the London Handicap Score (LHS). Measures were compared at 2 time points: pre-event status for stroke, TBI and the polio cohort, and 12-month postdischarge status for stroke and TBI.
   Results: The different measures generally correlated highly within disease states at each time point. Principal components analysis revealed 2 underlying dimensions, a physical dimension onto which loaded the Barthel Index, FIM, PCS, and LHS and a cognitive/emotional dimension onto which loaded the MCS and, for subjects with polio, the CIQ. These 2 dimensions accounted for 69% of the variance in measures at the pre-event time point and 85% of the variance at the 12-month time point.
   Conclusions: These data Suggest 2 basic underlying dimensions across a wide range of measures in 3 different neurologic conditions even at different time points. Most of the variation in the measures can be captured using the 2 component summary scores (PCS, MCS) of the SF-36.

AB Background: Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) are well-understood in the general population, but are not adequately understood among persons with disabilities.
   Objective: To describe and compare BMI and WC among individuals with muscular dystrophy (MD), multiple sclerosis (MS), post-polio syndrome (PPS), and spinal cord injury (SCI). BMI scores were also compared to normative data of the U. S. population, with consideration for age, sex, and mobility limitations.
   Methods: Persons with MD (n = 339), MS (n = 597), PPS (n = 443), and SCI (n = 488) completed postal surveys that included self-reported BMI and WC data. NHANES data were used to compare the current sample with a representative US sample.
   Results: Participants with PPS had higher BMI than participants with MD, MS, and SCI. In addition, participants with MS had significantly higher BMI relative to participants with SCI. BMI was significantly positively associated with age, years since diagnosis, mobility, and interactions of some of these factors. Relative to the general population, BMI was lower in MD, MS, and SCI across age groups, as well as in men with PPS and women ages 60-74 years with PPS. No significant differences were identified between MD, MS, PPS, and SCI in WC.
   Conclusions: The presence of group differences in BMI and absence of group differences in WC suggests that BMI may not accurately represent health risk in SCI, MD, and possibly MS, because of biasing elements of the conditions, such as changes in body composition and mobility limitations.

AB Objective. The member states of the 41st World Health Assembly agreed to aim for the global eradication of polio by the year 2000. Turkey adopted this goal and made substantial progress. In this report, we present the results of a coverage and risk factor survey conducted to evaluate vaccine delivery during the 1999 national immunization days (NIDs) in a large district of Istanbul, Turkey. This study provides important information regarding risk factors and reasons for non-vaccination during the NIDs, defines rumours about the NIDs, and provides estimates of vaccination coverage.
   Setting and participants. A survey was conducted 3 - 10 days after the second round of 1999 NIDs using the standard expanded programme on immunization cluster survey method, for each of 10 health centre areas in Umraniye. In total., 2102 children were included in the analysis.
   Results. The vaccination coverage rate was 82.2%. Logistic regression analysis showed increased risk of non-vaccination in people who did not know the purpose of the NIDs, who had not had contact with a mobile vaccination team, who were unvaccinated in the first round of 1999 NIDs and who lived in the area of the Central Health Centre. Use of primary-level state healthcare facilities for routine childhood immunizations, and living in the area of the Adem Yavuz Health Centre had significant positive effects on vaccination.
   Conclusions. To achieve better results, better publicity of national. campaigns using mass media, and improved use of mobile teams, are necessary. (C) 2003 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Zero-dose children and the extended immunisation cascade: Understanding
   the path to full immunisation with six childhood vaccines in 43
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background As part of the Immunisation Agenda 2030, the World Health Organization set a goal to reduce the number of children who did not receive any routine vaccine by 50% by 2030. We aimed to describe the patterns of vaccines received for children with zero, one, and up to full vaccination, while considering newly deployed vaccines (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and rotavirus (ROTA) vaccine) alongside longstanding ones such as the Bacille Calmete-Gu & eacute;rin (BCG), diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DPT), and poliomyelitis vaccines, and measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). Methods We used data from national household surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys) carried out in 43 low- and middle-income countries since 2014. We calculated the immunisation cascade as a score ranging from zero to six, considering BCG, polio, DPT, and ROTA vaccines, and the MCV and PCV. We also described the most prevalent combination of vaccines. The analyses were pooled across countries and stratified by household wealth quintiles. Results In the pooled analyses with all countries combined, 9.0% of children failed to receive any vaccines, 58.6% received at least one dose of each of the six vaccines, and 47.2% were fully vaccinated with all doses. Among the few children receiving 1-5 vaccines, the most frequent were BCG vaccines, polio vaccines, DPT vaccines, PCV, ROTA vaccines, and MCV. Conclusions Targeting children with their initial vaccine is crucial, as those who receive a first vaccine are more likely to undergo subsequent vaccinations. Finding zero-dose children and starting their immunisation is essential to leaving no one behind during the era of Sustainable Development Goals.

TI MULTIPLE ANTIGEN FOR IMMUNIZATION AGAINST POLIOMYELITIS, DIPHTHERIA,
   PERTUSSIS, AND TETANUS .2. RESPONSE OF INFANTS AND YOUNG-CHILDREN TO
   PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION AND 18-MONTH BOOSTER
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB A total of 298 children from 2 and one-half months through 5 years of age were observed, in order to study antibody response to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio antigens in one vaccine. Sub- jects received either the quadruple vaccine or a standard DPT control vaccine. Those under 6 months of age received 4 primary inoculations, while older subjects received only 3. Two hundred and twenty-four completed the primary series, and 104 of these returned for an 18- month booster dose. Serum antibody results showed that the quadruple vaccine induced a satisfactory response to all antigen components. The 4th dose given to the younger infants brough their antibody levels in line with those obtained in older children with only 3 doses. The booster dose produced a uniformly high response to all component antigens, regardless of the age at which primary immunization was begun and regardless of the antibody level following the primary series. No clinical reactions of any serious consequence were reported or observed.

AB The eradication of diseases through vaccination has been a long-standing problem in developing countries. The supply chain plays an essential role in end-to-end connection and enhancing the effectiveness of successful immunization. However, no study highlights the vaccine supply chain's role in maximizing stakeholder outreach and a successful vaccination campaign. The supply chain cannot be applied as a 'one size fits all,' 'centralized,' or a 'black box approach' to every vaccination area, as each may require specific inputs from the supply chain. This study considers the Poliovirus eradication program at immunization centres in several vaccination areas in Pakistan and proposes tailored supply chain strategies that are conducive to the requirements of vaccination areas. There are four-fold contributions of this study, i.e., identification of several factors from the literature that can trigger various responses from the supply chain, prioritization of these factors using a graph theory approach, grouping of vaccination areas based on the similarity of factors for the formulation of supply chain strategies, and proposing three tiers of the customer-facing arc of integration for the vaccination areas. The first tier of integration strategies comprises accurate demand forecasts, controlling wastage, and enhancing synchronization among vaccination and other health services. The second tier of integration strategies comprises a mix of centralization and de-centralization, coordination, and robust information systems, considering the relocation of vaccination centres to population epicentres. The third tier of integration strategies comprises increased investment in awareness programs, increasing partnerships with private partners, and ensuring the well-being of personnel and ground support staff. Finally, the conclusion, limitations, and future recommendations are provided.

AB Background: Nigeria has made notable gains in improving childhood survival but the country still accounts for a large portion of the world's overall disease burden, particularly among women and children. To date, no systematic analyses have comprehensively assessed trends for health outcomes and interventions across states in Nigeria.
   Methods: We extracted data from 19 surveys to generate estimates for 20 key maternal and child health (MCH) interventions and outcomes for 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory from 2000 to 2013. Source-specific estimates were generated for each indicator, after which a two-step statistical model was applied using a mixed-effects model followed by Gaussian process regression to produce state-level trends. National estimates were calculated by population-weighting state values.
   Results: Under-5 mortality decreased in all states from 2000 to 2013, but a large gap remained across them. Malaria intervention coverage stayed low despite increases between 2009 and 2013, largely driven by rising rates of insecticide-treated net ownership. Overall, vaccination coverage improved, with notable increases in the coverage of three-dose oral polio vaccine. Nevertheless, immunization coverage remained low for most vaccines, including measles. Coverage of other MCH interventions, such as antenatal care and skilled birth attendance, generally stagnated and even declined in many states, and the range between the lowest-and highest-performing states remained wide in 2013. Countrywide, a measure of overall intervention coverage increased from 33% in 2000 to 47% in 2013 with considerable variation across states, ranging from 21% in Sokoto to 66% in Ekiti.
   Conclusions: We found that Nigeria made notable gains for a subset of MCH indicators between 2000 and 2013, but also experienced stalled progress and even declines for others. Despite progress for a subset of indicators, Nigeria's absolute levels of intervention coverage remained quite low. As Nigeria rolls out its National Health Bill and seeks to strengthen its delivery of health services, continued monitoring of local health trends will help policymakers track successes and promptly address challenges as they arise. Subnational benchmarking ought to occur regularly in Nigeria and throughout sub-Saharan Africa to inform local decision-making and bolster health system performance.

AB Background: Social media can act as an important platform for debating, discussing, and disseminating information about vaccines. Our objectives were to map and describe the roles played by web-based mainstream media and social media as platforms for vaccination-related public debates and discussions during the Polio crisis in Israel in 2013: where and how did the public debate and discuss the issue, and how can these debates and discussions be characterized?
   Method: Polio-related coverage was collected from May 28 to October 31, 2013, from seven online Hebrew media platforms and the Facebook groups discussing the Polio vaccination were mapped and described. In addition, 2,289 items from the Facebook group "Parents talk about Polio vaccination" were analyzed for socio-demographic and thematic characteristics.
   Results: The traditional media mainly echoed formal voices from the Ministry of Health. The comments on the Facebook vaccination opposition groups could be divided into four groups: comments with individualistic perceptions, comments that expressed concerns about the safety of the OPV, comments that expressed distrust in the Ministry of Health, and comments denying Polio as a disease. In the Facebook group "Parents talk about the Polio vaccination", an active group with various participants, 321 commentators submitted 2289 comments, with 64 % of the comments written by women. Most (92 %) people involved were parents. The comments were both personal (referring to specific situations) and general in nature (referring to symptoms or wide implications). A few (13 %) of the commentators were physicians (n = 44), who were responsible for 909 (40 %) of the items in the sample. Half the doctors and 6 % of the non-doctors wrote over 10 items each. This Facebook group formed a unique platform where unmediated debates and discussions between the public and medical experts took place.
   Conclusion: The comments on the social media, as well as the socio-demographic profiles of the commentators, suggest that social media is an active and versatile debate and discussion-facilitating platform in the context of vaccinations. This paper presents public voices, which should be seen as authentic (i.e. unmediated by the media or other political actors) and useful for policy making purposes. The policy implications include identifying social media as a main channel of communication during health crises, and acknowledging the voices heard on social media as authentic and useful for policy making. Human and financial resources need to be devolved specifically to social media. Health officials and experts need to be accessible on social media, and be equipped to readily provide the information, support and advice the public is looking for.

AB Over the past 50 years, the use of vaccines led to significant decreases in the global burdens of measles and rubella, motivated at least in part by the successive development of global control and elimination targets. The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) includes specific targets for regional elimination of measles and rubella in five of six regions of the World Health Organization by 2020. Achieving the GVAP measles and rubella goals will require significant immunization efforts and associated financial investments and political commitments. Planning and budgeting for these efforts can benefit from learning some important lessons from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Following an overview of the global context of measles and rubella risks and discussion of lessons learned from the GPEI, we introduce the contents of the special issue on modeling and managing the risks of measles and rubella. This introduction describes the synthesis of the literature available to support evidence-based model inputs to support the development of an integrated economic and dynamic disease transmission model to support global efforts to optimally manage these diseases globally using vaccines.

AB Two conundrums puzzle COVID-19 investigators: 1) morbidity and mortality is rare among infants and young children and 2) rates of morbidity and mortality exhibit large variances across nations, locales, and even within cities. It is found that the higher the rate of pneumococcal vaccination in a nation (or city) the lower the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Vaccination rates with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, poliovirus, and other vaccines do not correlate with COVID-19 risks, nor do COVID-19 case or death rates correlate with number of people in the population with diabetes, obesity, or adults over 65. Infant protection may be due to maternal antibodies and antiviral proteins in milk such as lactoferrin that are known to protect against coronavirus infections. Subsequent protection might then be conferred (and correlate with) rates ofHaemophilus influenzaetype B (Hib) (universal in infants) and pneumococcal vaccination, the latter varying widely by geography among infants, at-risk adults, and the elderly.

TI Impact and effect mechanisms of mass campaigns in resource-constrained
   health systems: quasi-experimental evidence from polio eradication in
   Nigeria

AB Background Mass campaigns are a key strategy for delivering life-saving interventions under Global Health Initiatives, especially in weak health system contexts. They are frequently designed parallel to the health system to rapidly achieve programme targets such as vaccination coverage, but we lack quantitative evidence demonstrating their impact and effect mechanisms on health system performance at sub-/national level. This longitudinal study responds to this gap through an analysis of polio eradication campaigns in Nigeria.
   Methods Using four rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys in Nigeria between October 2000 and December 2017, we created a longitudinal dataset containing 88 881 under-5 children/pregnancies. We estimated the relationships between individuals' campaign exposure and health system performance indices (full RI schedule attainment, maternal healthcare services utilisation and child survival) using multilevel, mixed-effects regression models applied nationally and stratified by the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria.
   Results Nationally, high-frequency mass campaigns had detrimental health systems effects that potentially left 3.6 million children deprived of full immunisation. The frequency of campaigns was most concentrated in regions with weak health systems, where the operations of RI were disrupted, alongside negative effects on child survival and institutional delivery. In contrast, regions with relatively strong health systems and few campaigns experienced beneficial effects on maternal healthcare service utilisation.
   Conclusions As we provide evidence that well-functioning health systems can benefit from mass campaigns under Global Health Initiatives, our work also challenges the established wisdom to intensify mass campaigns in weaker health systems to bypass service provision bottlenecks. Mass campaigns do not inherently benefit or damage a health system, but frequent campaigns in weak health system contexts can impede service provision. We call for an additional burden of proof and active efforts to integrate mass campaigns into routine health services by harmonising implementation plans and service delivery in weak health system contexts.

AB Measles outbreaks in the United States continue to occur in subpopulations with sufficient numbers of undervaccinated individuals, with a 2014 outbreak in Amish communities in Ohio pushing the annual cases to the highest national number reported in the last 20 years. We adapted an individual-based model developed to explore potential poliovirus transmission in the North American Amish to characterize a 1988 measles outbreak in the Pennsylvania Amish and the 2014 outbreak in the Ohio Amish. We explored the impact of the 2014 outbreak response compared to no or partial response. Measles can spread very rapidly in an underimmunized subpopulation like the North American Amish, with the potential for national spread within a year or so in the absence of outbreak response. Vaccination efforts significantly reduced the transmission of measles and the expected number of cases. Until global eradication, measles importations will continue to pose a threat to clusters of underimmunized individuals in the United States. Aggressive outbreak response efforts in Ohio probably prevented widespread transmission of measles within the entire North American Amish.

TI Quality of life and menopause in women with physical disabilities
SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; POSTPOLIO SYNDROME; POLIO SURVIVORS; PSYCHOLOGICAL
   DISTRESS; POLIOMYELITIS SEQUELAE; SYMPTOM LIST; HEALTH; SATISFACTION;
   ILLNESS; MIDLIFE
AB Objective: The goal of this cross-sectional study was to explore quality of life (QOL) in a sample of postmenopausal women with physical disabilities due to polio contracted in childhood. A structural equation model was used to confirm that menopause symptoms will have a minimal effect on QOL when disability-related variables are taken into account.
   Methods: A sample of 752 women who were postmenopausal completed a written survey. The structural equation model contained two measured predictors (age, severity of postpolio sequelae) and one latent predictor (menopause symptoms defined by four measured indicators). Functional status (defined by two measured indicators) was included as a mediator, with QOL (defined by three measured indicators) as the outcome.
   Results: The original model yielded acceptable fit indices (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.055) but resulted in a number of unexpected relationships that proved to be artifacts after model re-specification. The respecified model yielded a nonsignificant chi-square value, which indicated no significant discrepancy between the proposed model and the observed data (chisquare = 18.5, df = 13, p = 0.138). All fit indices indicated a good fit: CFI = 0.997, NNFI = 0.987, chi-square/df = 1.43, and RMSEA = 0.024).
   Conclusions: When the effects of postpolio sequelae and functional status are included in the structural equation model, only the psychological symptoms of menopause play a prominent role in explaining QOL in this sample. The clinical implications of these findings suggest that attention to psychological symptoms and an exclusive focus on the physical aspects of menopause to the exclusion of other midlife life stressors and influences on a woman's psychological well-being ignore the larger context of life in which they live. In particular, many women with disabilities may contend with additional or exacerbated stressors related to their disability.

SO PEDIATRICS

AB Objective. To identify factors associated with undervaccination at 3 months and 24 months among low-income, inner-city Latino and African-American preschool children.
   Design. Interviews with a representative sample of inner-city families using a cross-sectional, multi-stage, cluster-sample design combined with a replicated quota sampling approach.
   Setting. South Central and East Los Angeles areas in inner-city Los Angeles.
   Population. Eight hundred seventeen Latino and 387 African-American families with children between 12 and 36 months of age.
   Main Outcome Variables. Being fully immunized or up-to-date (UTD) at 3 months (1 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and 1 oral polio vaccine) and 24 months of age (4 diphtheria-tetanus-p ertussis vaccines, 3 oral p olio vaccines, and 1 measles-mumps-rubella vaccine).
   Methods. Logistic regressions of UTD immunization status at 3 and 24 months by population and health care system factors.
   Results. Seventy percent of Latino children and 53% of African-American children were UTD at 3 months of age. At 24 months of age, 42% of Latino children and 26% of African-American children were UTD on their immunizations. Receipt of the first immunizations by 3 months was associated with smaller family size, and evidence of connection to prenatal care. Latino children were less likely to be UTD at 24 months if they obtained well child fare from private providers versus public clinics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26, 0.79). There was also a trend for Latino children to be less well immunized if they were in health maintenance organizations versus public clinics (0.31,.0.05 < P <.1). African-American children were more likely to be UTD at 24 months if they were UTD at 3 months (OR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.43, 21.6), had more health visits (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.27), and were less likely to be UTD at 24 months if they were on Medicaid versus private insurance (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.90).
   Implications. Both African-American and Latino children in inner-city Los Angeles have low immunization rates at 3 and 24 months. Prenatal care and family size are strongly associated with being UTD by 3 months; however, family and child characteristics are relatively unimportant predictors of being UTD at 24 months of age. Important risk factors for underimmunization at 2 years of age in the inner-city, low-income communities studied include type of health insurance and source of well child care, with the public sector having higher rates than private doctors' offices or health maintenance organization/managed care plans.

AB Background: Live attenuated vaccines may be used to prevent nontargeted diseases such as lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) due to their nonspecific effects (NSEs). Objective: We aimed to analyze the NSEs of the Japanese encephalitis vaccine on pediatric LRTIs in children aged 25 months to 35 months. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using a population -based electronic health record database in Zhejiang, China. Enrolled participants were children born from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, and who were inoculated with the live -attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JE-L) or inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JE-I) as the most recent vaccine at 24 months of age. The study was carried out between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. All inpatient and outpatient hospital visits for LRTIs among children aged 25 months to 35 months were recorded. The Andersen -Gill model was used to assess the NSEs of JE-L against LRTIs in children and compared with those of JE-I as the most recent vaccine. Results: A total of 810 children born in 2017 were enrolled, of whom 585 received JE-L (JE-L cohort) and 225 received JE-I (JE-I cohort) as their last vaccine. The JE-L cohort showed a reduced risk of LRTIs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.537, 95% CI 0.416-0.693), including pneumonia (aHR 0.501, 95% CI 0.393-0.638) and acute bronchitis (aHR 0.525, 95% CI 0.396-0.698) at 25 months to 35 months of age. The NSEs provided by JE-L were especially pronounced in female children (aHR 0.305, 95% CI 0.198-0.469) and children without chronic diseases (aHR 0.553, 95% CI 0.420-0.729), without siblings (aHR 0.361, 95% CI 0.255-0.511), with more than 30 inpatient and outpatient hospital visits prior to 24 months of age (aHR 0.163, 95% CI 0.091-0.290), or with 5 to 10 inpatient and outpatient hospital visits due to infectious diseases prior to 24 months old (aHR 0.058, 95% CI 0.017-0.202). Conclusions: Compared with JE-I, receiving JE-L as the most recent vaccine was associated with lower risk of inpatient and outpatient hospital visits for LRTIs among children aged 25 months to 35 months. The nature of NSEs induced by JE-L should be considered for policymakers and physicians when recommending JE vaccines to those at high risk of infection from the Japanese encephalitis virus.

AB Each year millions of pilgrims perform the annual Hajj from more than 180 countries around the world. This is one of the largest mass gathering events and may result in the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. As such, there are mandatory vaccinations for the pilgrims such as meningococcal vaccines. The 2019 annual Hajj will take place during August 8-13, 2019. Thus, we review the recommended and mandated vaccinations for the 2019 Hajj and Umrah. The mandatory vaccines required to secure the visa include the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine for all pilgrims, while yellow fever, and poliomyelitis vaccines are required for pilgrims coming from countries endemic or with disease activity. The recommended vaccines are influenza, pneumococcal, in addition to full compliance with basic vaccines for all pilgrims against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, and mumps. It is imperative to continue surveillance for the spread of antimicrobial resistance and occurrence of all infectious diseases causing outbreaks across the globe in the last year, like Zika virus, MDR-Typhoid, Nipah, Ebola, cholera, chikungunya and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

TI 'Silent' and 'noisy' areas: acute flaccid paralysis surveillance at

SO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance; Australia; Polio; Surveillance;
   Surveillance performance indicators
AB Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance rates are used as an indicator of surveillance sensitivity to detect poliomyelitis with an expected rate of a parts per thousand<yen>1 case per 100 000 population in children under 15 years of age.
   The Australian AFP detection rates at sub-national (statistical local area) level were analysed using chi(2) goodness of fit tests and exact Poisson probabilities for the combined years 2001-2015 to detect 'silent areas', which may require improved AFP detection efforts, and areas with greater than expected rates, which may indicate unexplained clusters such as those due to enterovirus infection.
   Eight (n=8/87, 9%) local areas had AFP surveillance detection rates that were less than expected, and eighteen local areas (n=18/87, 21%) had rates that were greater than expected. However, based on available evidence, it is unlikely that these indicated previously unidentified, enterovirus clusters.
   While Australia has regularly met the national AFP surveillance performance indicators, at the subnational level nine per cent of local areas demonstrated statistically significant lower AFP detection rates. All countries, even those with relatively small populations, should actively identify silent AFP areas to prompt surveillance improvements.

AB Objective. We evaluated the association between parents' beliefs about vaccines, their decision to delay or refuse vaccines for their children, and vaccination coverage of children at aged 24 months.
   Methods. We used data from 11,206 parents of children aged 24-35 months at the time of the 2009 National Immunization Survey interview and determined their vaccination status at aged 24 months. Data included parents' reports of delay and/or refusal of vaccine doses, psychosocial factors suggested by the Health Belief Model, and provider-reported up-to-date vaccination status.
   Results. In 2009, approximately 60.2% of parents with children aged 24-35 months neither delayed nor refused vaccines, 25.8% only delayed, 8.2% only refused, and 5.8% both delayed and refused vaccines. Compared with parents who neither delayed nor refused vaccines, parents who delayed and refused vaccines were significantly less likely to believe that vaccines are necessary to protect the health of children (70.1% vs. 96.2%), that their child might get a disease if they aren't vaccinated (71.0% vs. 90.0%), and that vaccines are safe (50.4% vs. 84.9%). Children of parents who delayed and refused also had significantly lower vaccination coverage for nine of the 10 recommended childhood vaccines including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (65.3% vs. 85.2%), polio (76.9% vs. 93.8%), and measles-mumps-rubella (68.4% vs. 92.5%). After adjusting for sociodemographic differences, we found that parents who were less likely to agree that vaccines are necessary to protect the health of children, to believe that their child might get a disease if they aren't vaccinated, or to believe that vaccines are safe had significantly lower coverage for all 10 childhood vaccines.
   Conclusions. Parents who delayed and refused vaccine doses were more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines. Guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics may assist providers in responding to parents who may delay or refuse vaccines.

AB Objectives: To evaluate trends in national vaccination coverage from 2000 to 2007 among children aged 19-35 months for at least four doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (4 + DTaP), three doses of poliovirus vaccine (3 + Polio), one dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (1 + MMR), three doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (3 + Hib), three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (3 + HepB), one dose of Varicella vaccine (1 + Var), and the standard vaccine series of these six vaccines (4:3:1:1:3:3:1). To predict vaccination coverage levels in 2008-2010 for those vaccines that have not yet reached the Healthy People 2010 coverage targets of 90% for individual vaccines and 80% for the vaccine series.
   Methods: Data were analyzed for 167,086 children aged 19-35 months in the 2000-2007 National Immunization Survey. Vaccination coverage trends were analyzed with weighted least squares linear regression models. Nonlinear Weibull and logarithmic regression models were fitted to these past results, and extrapolation was used to predict vaccination coverage levels for 4 + DTaP, 1 + Var, and the 4:3:1:3:3:1 series from 2008 to 2010.
   Results: From 2000 to 2007, observed vaccination coverage increased significantly for four of the six vaccines and the standard vaccine series, and reached the 90% target for 3 + Polio, 1 + MMR, 3 + Hib, and 3 + HepB. Increases in coverage were not significant for 1 + MMR and 3 + Hib; however, coverage for these vaccines was consistently> 90% throughout the study period. Both Weibull and logarithmic regression models predicted that coverage with 1 +Var and the 4:1:1:3:3:1 series will surpass the 2010 target by 2008, while coverage with 4 + DTaP will fall short of the target at 86% in 2010.
   Conclusions: The United States is well on the way toward reaching most of the Healthy People 2010 objectives for early childhood vaccination coverage. Enhanced efforts are needed to ensure that these trends continue, and to increase coverage with 4 + DTaP. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Globally, countries are increasingly prioritizing the reduction of health inequalities and provision of universal health coverage. While national benchmarking has become more common, such work at subnational levels is rare. The timely and rigorous measurement of local levels and trends in key health interventions and outcomes is vital to identifying areas of progress and detecting early signs of stalled or declining health system performance. Previous studies have yet to provide a comprehensive assessment of Uganda's maternal and child health (MCH) landscape at the subnational level.
   Methods: By triangulating a number of different data sources - population censuses, household surveys, and administrative data - we generated regional estimates of 27 key MCH outcomes, interventions, and socioeconomic indicators from 1990 to 2011. After calculating source-specific estimates of intervention coverage, we used a two-step statistical model involving a mixed-effects linear model as an input to Gaussian process regression to produce regional-level trends. We also generated national-level estimates and constructed an indicator of overall intervention coverage based on the average of 11 high-priority interventions.
   Results: National estimates often veiled large differences in coverage levels and trends across Uganda's regions. Under-5 mortality declined dramatically, from 163 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 85 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011, but a large gap between Kampala and the rest of the country persisted. Uganda rapidly scaled up a subset of interventions across regions, including household ownership of insecticide-treated nets, receipt of artemisinin-based combination therapies among children under 5, and pentavalent immunization. Conversely, most regions saw minimal increases, if not actual declines, in the coverage of indicators that required multiple contacts with the health system, such as four or more antenatal care visits, three doses of oral polio vaccine, and two doses of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy. Some of the regions with the lowest levels of overall intervention coverage in 1990, such as North and West Nile, saw marked progress by 2011; nonetheless, sizeable disparities remained between Kampala and the rest of the country. Countrywide, overall coverage increased from 40 % in 1990 to 64 % in 2011, but coverage in 2011 ranged from 57 % to 70 % across regions.
   Conclusions: The MCH landscape in Uganda has, for the most part, improved between 1990 and 2011. Subnational benchmarking quantified the persistence of geographic health inequalities and identified regions in need of additional health systems strengthening. The tracking and analysis of subnational health trends should be conducted regularly to better guide policy decisions and strengthen responsiveness to local health needs.

TI The true test: Alternative safer designs for drugs and medical devices
   in a patent-constrained market
SO UCLA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article

   STANDARD; DEFECT; DUTY; LAW
AB In section 6(c) of the Products Liability Restatement, Professors James Henderson and Aaron Twerski, the American Law Institute (ALI) reporters, rejected the ordinary test of product design defect (the section 2(b) reasonable alternative design test) for prescription drugs and medical devices. For such medical products the ALI rule enunciates a manufacturer-protective standard, declaring that under it liability would only "rarely" be imposed. A product is defective under section 6(c) only if it provides no net benefit for any foreseeable class of patients. The rule was challenged in an earlier article by Professor Conk. The first state supreme court to confront the issue, Nebraska's, rejected the Restatement rule. This Article discusses the issue of the character of the proofs of design defect, which the Nebraska court indicated it will address in the future.
   In a rebuttal, the reporters now embrace an alternative safer design test for drugs, But they would limit the test to comparison with FDA-approved products actually available on the market at the time of sale of the challenged product. The reporters' broad, saving construction is welcomed. But Conk finds the reporters' new reading to be an unconvincing exegesis, if nonetheless a small step forward.
   The reporters assert that courts are incompetent to judge drug product design defect claims because they would have to replicate the complex FDA approval process in order to pass upon a plaintiff's alternative safer design. This is a much greater burden than that for all other classes of products-for which no prototype need be produced, nor an alternative be shown to be on the market.
   The new broader construction is still inadequate. The problem of showing the existence of an alternative safer design in a patent-monopolized market is discussed. Conk argues that in patent-monopolized markets the burden on the plaintiff to produce an alternative design should be lighter than in robust markets open to competition. In more open markets the absence of a safer product on the market may carry greater evidentiary weight on the issues of the feasibility and practicality of the plaintiffs proposed alternative design.
   Three case studies of drugs for which liability could be found under the alternative safer design test of section 2(b), but would be excused under the manufacturer-protective test of section 6(c), are discussed-the anti-acne drug
   Accutane, unpasteurized Antihemophilic Factor concentrate (AHF), and Sabin live virus oral polio vaccine.
   Finally, pointing to medical devices like IUD's and tampons, and the fact that mechanical devices are more amenable to alternative safer design analysis than are drugs, the Article discusses the "final fatal flaw" of section 6(c)-its treatment of both drugs and devices by the same manufacturer-deferential standard of liability.

ID DISTRICT
AB Reported high immunization coverage achieved in Nepal over the last ten years is expected to reduce child mortality in the country. The present study, carried out in a hill district in mid-west Nepal, aimed to assess the quality of immunization data in Nepal. The number of children who received different vaccines during one year was obtained from three sources: 1) the Immunization Register of three Primary Health Care Service Outlets (PHCSOs) where each immunized child is recorded; 2) monthly PHC Reports, which are based on the Immunization Register; 3) monthly DHO Reports, which are based on the above PHC Reports (the DHO reports are the source of official statistics). The number of children in the PHC Reports was higher than the number in the Immunization Registers for all vaccines. The number of immunizations in the DHO Reports was higher than the number in the PHC Reports for BCG, DPT, and measles; the number was lower for poliomyelitis. The overall number of immunizations was higher in the DHO Reports than in the Immunization Registers, by 31% for BCG, 44% for DPT, 155% for polio, and 71% for measles. We conclude that the official report overestimates the immunization coverage in the district. The immunization programme, therefore, might not result in the expected reduction of morbidity and mortality despite the investment in the programme and reported high coverage.

AB The objective of this article was to consider the vaccination challenges in Colombia and Peru and the role of pediatric combination vaccines in overcoming these challenges. Barriers to including new vaccines with more antigens remain apparent in parts of these countries, where vaccine-preventable diseases in infants continue to be a major problem. The challenges include the heterogeneity of vaccine coverage within each country and in neighboring countries, which can contribute to poor rates of vaccination coverage; the adverse impact of the inward migration of unvaccinated individuals, which has favored the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases; vaccine shortages; and the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the associated shifts in health care resources. To improve the coverage of pediatric vaccines in Colombia and Peru, it will be necessary to ensure the widespread integration into vaccine sched-ules of combination vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B antigens with a three-dose primary series delivered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age followed by a booster at 18 months of age. Such vaccines play important roles in preventing diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; eradicating polio; and providing boosting against H. influenzae type b.

   recovered from severe poliomyelitis

AB The relationship between 'narrative' and 'historical-biographical truth' in psychoanalytic treatment has become the subject of many controversial debates in recent years. Findings of contemporary memory research have lead to great scepticism as to whether therapists are able objectively and reliably to reconstruct biographical events on the basis of their observations in the therapeutic situation. Some authors even claim that psychoanalysts should concentrate exclusively on observing the here and now of the patient's behaviour within the transference relationship to the analyst. In this paper it will be discussed whether the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater in this debate. Centred around the insights from a third psychoanalysis with a patient who suffered from a severe case of childhood polio, the hypothesis will be discussed that working through the traumatic experience in the transference with the analyst, as well as the reconstruction of the biographical-historical reality of the trauma suffered, prove to be indispensable for a lasting structural change.
   Integration of the trauma into one's own personal history and identity is and remains one of the main aims of a psychoanalytic treatment with severely traumatized patients. The reconstruction of the original trauma is indispensable in helping the patient to understand the 'language of the body' and to connect it with visualizations, images and verbalizations. The irreversable wounds and vulnerability of his body as the 'signs of his specific traumatic history' have to be recognized, emotionally accepted and understood in order to live with them and not deny them any longer. Another important aspect in psychoanalysis is to develop the capability to mentalize, in other words, to understand the intentions of central (primary) objects related to the trauma.
   The concept of 'embodied memory' might be helpful in understanding precisely in what way 'early trauma is remembered by the body'. Observing in detail the sensory-motor coordinations in the analytic relationship enables one to decode the inappropriate intensity of affects and fantasies which match the original traumatic interaction and are revealed as inappropriate reactions in the present, new relationship to the analyst.

TI Costs of polio immunization days in China: Implications for mass

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID POLIOMYELITIS; ERADICATION
AB Ten provinces of China were selected to estimate the cost per immunization of the 1994-95 national immunization days (NIDs) at five levels (e.g. province, prefecture, county, township and village). Personnel costs accounted for the largest overall share of costs (39 per cent), followed by publicity and promotion costs (27 per cent), and logistic costs (15 per cent). Without consideration of vaccine costs, the major part of NID expenses were shouldered at the township level, which paid for 47 per cent of all incremental costs, while county and village level covered 28 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. Estimation of average costs per immunization was 2.86 RMB yuan, or $0.34, including vaccine costs, buildings and equipment amortization and salaries at all levels. The factors affecting average cost of NID included the output volume, socio-economic development and geographic features.
   Various approaches were recommended: to intensify the productivity of time and staff, to employ alternative inexpensive manpower resources, to make the best use of publicity and social promotion, the expansion of the age groups and utilization of multi-intervention strategies. Good planning at township level was a decisive factor to ensure an effective NID conducted in an efficient manner. The average cost of China's NID was the lowest among all mass immunization campaigns ever documented. Much of the reduced average cost was attributable to economies of scale.

AB Purpose. This study aimed to explore the perceived work ability of patients with postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS), to identify barriers and factors that are impeding or conducive, respectively, to work participation, and to identify possible interventions.
   Methods. Qualitative cross-sectional interview study with 17 subjects with PPS, 12 women and 5 men, mean age 49 years (SD: 11). Semi-structured interviews were held with the subjects in their homes, with the aid of a topic list. The COREQ criteria list for qualitative research was used as guideline in design and analysis.
   Results. Thirteen out of 17 subjects rated their work ability six or higher on a scale from 0 to 10. Most subjects worked in an administrative, educational or managerial function. Five subjects stopped working, four worked between 0 and 20 h/week and eight worked between 20 and 40 h/week. Factors conducive to working were physical adaptations in the workplace, accessibility of the workplace and high decision latitude. Barriers to full work ability in PPS patients were high physical job demands, low social support and the symptoms of PPS, especially fatigue and pain.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that work-oriented interventions aimed at preventing PPS patients from dropping out of the workforce should primarily focus on reducing physical job demands, arranging adaptations in the workplace and increasing job control.

ID ERADICATION
AB Background: Four wild polio-virus cases were reported in Borno State, Nigeria 2016, 1 year after Nigeria had been removed from the list of polio endemic countries by the World Health Organization. Resulting from Nigeria's decade long conflict with Boko Haram, health officials had been unable to access as much as 60% of the settlements in Borno, hindering vaccination and surveillance efforts. This lack of accessibility made it difficult for the government to assess the current population distribution within Borno. This study aimed to use high resolution, visible band satellite imagery to assess the habitation of inaccessible villages in Borno State.
   Methods: Using high resolution (31-50 cm) imagery from DigitalGlobe, analysts evaluated the habitation status of settlements in Borno State identified by Nigeria's Vaccination Tracking System. The analysts looked at imagery of each settlement and, using vegetation (overgrowth vs. cleared) as a proxy for human habitation, classified settlements into three categories: inhabited, partially abandoned, and abandoned. Analysts also classified the intact percentage of each settlement starting at 0% (totally destroyed since last assessment) and increasing in 25% intervals through 100% (completely intact but not expanded) up to 200+% (more than doubled in size) by looking for destroyed buildings. These assessments were then used to adjust previously established population estimates for each settlement. These new population distributions were compared to vaccination efforts to determine the number of children under 5 unreached by vaccination teams.
   Results: Of the 11,927 settlements assessed 3203 were assessed as abandoned (1892 of those completely destroyed), 662 as partially abandoned, and 8062 as fully inhabited as of December of 2017. Comparing the derived population estimates from the new assessments to previous assessment and the activities of vaccination teams shows that an estimated 180,155 of the 337,411 under five children who were unreached in 2016 were reached in 2017 (70.5% through vaccination efforts in previously inaccessible areas, 29.5% through displacement to accessible areas).
   Conclusions: This study's methodology provides important planning and situation awareness information to health workers in Borno, Nigeria, and may serve as a model for future data gathering efforts in inaccessible regions.

AB Even though they are important determinants for increasing vaccination rates in advanced and developing nations alike, maternal capacity and decisional authority have not been fully elucidated in diverse countries and cultural spheres. This study examined the effects of South Korean, Chinese, and Japanese mothers' health literacy, self-efficacy, mass media use, and decisional authority on their children's vaccination after adjustment for their socioeconomic statuses. Computer-assisted web interviews were conducted with married women in their 20s-40s of South Korean, Chinese, or Japanese nationality (n = 1,571). Dependent variables were generated for the following four vaccinations: BCG, diphtheria +pertussis+tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (polio), and measles. For statistical processing, cases where all four types of vaccines had been recorded were scored as 1 and other cases were processed as 0. According to the results of the pooled model, we found that for East Asian mothers, decisional authority, self-efficacy, and health literacy all increased the likelihood that they would vaccinate their children. Furthermore, women who searched for health information through media such as the radio were more likely to vaccinate their children. However, when elaborate analyses were conducted by country, there were considerable differences in those characteristics by country. Therefore, this study showed that it is necessary to establish locally tailored strategies in order to raise vaccination rates in the Global Vaccine Action Plan. This study also showed that social contexts must be taken into consideration in order to raise vaccination rates.

AB In Indonesia responsibility for immunizations is placed on local government health centres and on the nurses who provide the immunizations at each centre. An on-the-job peer training programme for these nurses, which was designed to improve the immunization performance of poorly performing health centres in terms of coverage and practice in Maluku. province, was evaluated. Experienced immunization nurses were sent to health centres where nurses were inexperienced or performing poorly, the experienced nurses spent 1-2 weeks providing on-the-job training for the less experienced ones. An evaluation of the 13 centres that participated in the programme and the 95 that did not found that the programme increased both immunization coverage and the quality of practice. Coverage of diphtheria/periussis/tetanus (DPT), polio, and measles vaccinations rose by about 39% in all 13 participating centres when compared with non-participating centres, and by about 54% in the 11 centres that had a functioning transportation system during the year after training. These results reflect increases in the actual number of doses given and improvements in the accuracy of reports. Potential threats to the study's validity were examined and found not to be significant. The out-of-pocket cost of the training programme was about USE 53 per trainee or about USE 0.05 per additional vaccine reported to have been given. The marginal cost per additional fully immunized child was estimated to be US$ 0.50.

TI Benevolent personification of the MoH increases compliance with an

LA English
DT Article

ID TIME TRENDS; MMR; COMMUNICATION; A(H1N1); RISK
AB Objective: Parental compliance is crucial to the success of mass vaccination campaigns targeting children. Relying on psychological/neuroscientific research concerning the role of personification (i.e., viewing the inanimate as human) in behavior, the authors examined the effect of parents' personification of the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) on compliance with a publicly controversial mass vaccination campaign, which was aimed at stopping the spread of a wild poliovirus.
   Methods: Participants were 555 parents of children aged 9 or younger, residing in the center/north of Israel, an area covered by Phase 2 of the campaign. T1 assessment, employed two days prior to Phase 2, tapped into demographics, attitudes towards vaccination, intent to comply, and a benevolent personification of the MoH (i.e., "The MoH is caring") vs. a malevolent personification of the MoH ("The MoH is hysteric"). T2 assessment, transpiring four months after the end of the campaign, addressed presence and reasons for (non-)compliance.
   Results: The study's overall compliance rate was 61.8%. The principal reason for compliance was "adherence to the recommendations of the MoH" (68.49%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, prospective predictors of compliance were: an early intent to comply (O.R. = 2.56, p = 0.000), being male (O. R. =1.51, p = 0.023), and a benevolent personification of the MoH (O.R. = 1.21, p = 0.019).
   Conclusion: Parents who experienced the Israeli MoH as a benevolent protagonist were more likely to comply with the mass vaccination campaign. Findings highlight the role of leadership in public health campaigns during emergencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) has amassed a vast reservoir of genetic data since its inception in 2007. These public data hold immense potential for supporting pathogen surveillance and control. However, the lack of standardized metadata and inconsistent submission practices in SRA may impede the data's utility in public health.MethodsTo address this issue, we introduce the Search-based Geographic Metadata Curation (SGMC) pipeline. SGMC utilized Python and web scraping to extract geographic data of sequencing institutions from NCBI SRA in the Cloud and its website. It then harnessed ChatGPT to refine the sequencing institution and location assignments. To illustrate the pipeline's utility, we examined the geographic distribution of the sequencing institutions and their countries relevant to polio eradication and categorized them.ResultsSGMC successfully identified 7,649 sequencing institutions and their global locations from a random selection of 2,321,044 SRA accessions. These institutions were distributed across 97 countries, with strong representation in the United States, the United Kingdom and China. However, there was a lack of data from African, Central Asian, and Central American countries, indicating potential disparities in sequencing capabilities. Comparison with manually curated data for U.S. institutions reveals SGMC's accuracy rates of 94.8% for institutions, 93.1% for countries, and 74.5% for geographic coordinates.ConclusionSGMC may represent a novel approach using a generative AI model to enhance geographic data (country and institution assignments) for large numbers of samples within SRA datasets. This information can be utilized to bolster public health endeavors.

AB The year 2017 marks the 40th year of the establishment of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Americas, the first WHO region certified as eliminating poliomyelitis (1994), measles (2016), and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (2015). The English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean subregion of the Americas paved the way in eliminating these diseases. This report highlights the innovative strategies used in this subregion that helped make the EPI a success.
   A review of published/unpublished reports and written and oral accounts of the experiences of Immunization Advisors and national EPI managers was conducted to identify the strategies used to strengthen the Immunization program in the subregion since its implementation by countries in 1977. The results show that these include strong collective political commitment, country-specific immunization legislation, joint use of a standard coverage monitoring chart, annual meetings of national EPI managers, collaborative development of annual national Plans of Action for Immunization, coordinated implementation of vaccination campaigns, subregional oversight of surveillance and laboratory support, a performance award system for countries, and subregional standardized templates for immunization manuals and procedural guidelines. Political will and support for immunization has been particularly strong in this subregion, where 99% of EPI costs are borne by governments. Dedicated health staff and multi-country agreement and application of strategies have led to high sustained coverage and good-quality surveillance, resulting in the absence of wild polio for .34 years, measles for 25 years, CRS for 17 years, and rubella for 15 years.

TI Health workers and vaccination coverage in developing countries:: an
   econometric analysis
SO LANCET

DT Article
ID IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE; HUMAN-RESOURCES; MEASLES; DETERMINANTS;
   ERADICATION; CHILDREN; BANGLADESH; EDUCATION; POLIO; AREA
AB Background Vaccine-preventable diseases cause more than 1 million deaths among children in developing countries every year. Although health workers are needed to do vaccinations, the role of human resources for health as a determinant of vaccination coverage at the population level has not been investigated. our aim was to test whether health worker density was positively associated with childhood vaccination coverage in developing countries.
   Methods We did cross-country multiple regression analyses with coverage of three vaccinations-measles-containing vaccine (MCV); diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3); and poliomyelitis (polio3)-as dependent variables. Aggregate health worker density was an independent variable in one set of regressions; doctor and nurse densities were used separately in another set. We controlled for national income per person, female adult literacy, and land area.
   Findings Health worker density was significantly associated with coverage of all three vaccinations (MCV p=0.0024; DTP3 p=0.0004; polio3 p=0.0008). However, when the effects of doctors and nurses were assessed separately, we found that nurse density was significantly associated with coverage of all three vaccinations (MCV p=0.0097; DTP3 p=0.0083; polio3 p=0.0089), but doctor density was not (MCV p=0.7953; DTP3 p=0.7971; polio3 p=0.7885). Female adult literacy was positively associated, and land area negatively associated, with vaccination coverage. National income per person had no effect on coverage.
   Interpretation A higher density of health workers (nurses) increases the availability of vaccination services over time and space, making it more likely that children will be vaccinated. After controlling for other determinants, the level of income does not contribute to improved immunisation coverage. Health workers can be a major constraining factor on vaccination coverage in developing countries.

AB Background This study aimed to estimate the economic impact of replacing the current Peruvian primary immunization scheme for infants under 1 year old with an alternative scheme with similar efficacy, based on a hexavalent vaccine. Methods A cost-minimization analysis compared the costs associated with vaccine administration, adverse reactions medical treatment, logistical activities, and indirect social costs associated with time spent by parents in both schemes. A budgetary impact analysis assessed the financial impact of the alternative scheme on healthcare budget. Results Incorporating the hexavalent vaccine would result in a 15.5% net increase in healthcare budget expenditure ($48,281,706 vs $55,744,653). Vaccination costs would increase by 54.1%, whereas logistical and adverse reaction costs would be reduced by 59.8% and 33.1%, respectively. When including indirect social costs in the analysis, the budgetary impact was reduced to 8.7%. Furthermore, the alternative scheme would enable the liberation of 17.5% of national vaccines storage capacity. Conclusions Despite of the significant reduction of logistical and adverse reaction costs, including the hexavalent vaccine into the National Immunization Program of Peru in place of the current vaccination scheme for infants under 1 year of age would increase the public financial budget of the government as it would represent larger vaccine acquisition costs. Incorporating the indirect costs would reduce the budgetary impact demonstrating the social value of the alternative scheme. This merits consideration by government bodies, and future studies investigating such benefits would be informative.

AB This study examines vaccination hesitancy or refusal following the 2013 polio outbreak in Israel, based on two theoretical models. The first is Sandman's theoretical model, which holds that risk perception is comprised of hazard plus outrage. The second model is the affect heuristic that explains the risk/benefit confounding. It aims to expose the barriers that inhibited parental compliance with OPV vaccination for their children. The study employed mixed methods - a questionnaire survey (n=197) and content analysis of parents' discussions in blogs, Internet sites, and Facebook pages (n=2499). The findings indicate that some parents who normally give their children routine vaccinations decided not to give them OPV due to lack of faith in the health system, concerns about vaccine safety and reasons specific to the polio outbreak in Israel. Some vaccinated due to a misunderstanding, namely, they believed that OPV was supposed to protect their children, when it was actually for overall societal well-being. This study highlights the difficulty of framing the subject of vaccinations as a preventive measure, especially when the prevention is for society at large and not to protect the children themselves. The findings of this study are important because they provide a glimpse into a situation that can recur in different places in the world where a disease considered to have been eradicated' returns, and the public is required to take measures which protect the public but which might put individuals at risk. The conclusions from the analysis of the findings of this study are that the public's risk perception is based on a context-dependent analysis, which the communicating body must understand and respect.

AB Background: Annually, approximately 10 million pilgrims travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for Umrah from more than 180 countries. This event presents major challenges for the Kingdom's public health sector, which strives to decrease the burden of infectious diseases and to adequately control their spread both in KSA and pilgrims home nations. The aims of the study were to assess preventative measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional survey was administered to pilgrims from February to April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire comprised questions on sociodemographic information (age, gender, marital status, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses), whether the pilgrim had received any health education and orientation prior to coming to Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventative practices. Results: Pilgrims (n = 1012) of 41 nationalities completed the survey. Chronic diseases were reported among pilgrims (n = 387, 38.2%) with cardiovascular diseases being the most reported morbidity (n = 164, 42.3%). The majority of pilgrims had been immunized prior to travel to Saudi Arabia (n = 770, 76%). The most commonly reported immunizations were influenza (n = 514, 51%), meningitis (n = 418, 41%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n = 310, 31%). However, 242 (24%) had not received any vaccinations prior to travel, including meningitis vaccine and poliomyelitis vaccine, which are mandatory by Saudi Arabian health authorities for pilgrims coming from polio active countries. Nearly a third of pilgrims (n = 305; 30.1%) never wore a face mask in crowded areas during Umrah in 2019. In contrast, similar numbers said they always wore a face mask (n = 351, 34.6%) in crowded areas, while 63.2% reported lack of availability of face masks during Umrah. The majority of participants had received some form of health education on preventative measures, including hygiene aspects (n = 799, 78.9%), mostly in their home countries (n = 450, 44.4%). A positive association was found between receiving health education and practicing of preventative measures, such as wearing face masks in crowded areas (p = 0.04), and other health practice scores (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Although the experiences of the preventative measures among pilgrims in terms of health education, vaccinations, and hygienic practices were at times positive, this study identified several issues. These included the following preventative measures: immunizations, particularly meningitis and poliomyelitis vaccine, and using face masks in crowded areas. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for further studies that focus on development of accessible health education in a form that engages pilgrims to promote comprehensive preventative measures during Umrah and Hajj and other religious pilgrimages.

AB Background
   Despite efforts towards reducing childhood morbidity and mortality, Nigeria ranks among countries with the highest rates of vaccine-preventable diseases including tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, measles, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. These efforts include regular rounds of immunization days and routine exercises. The government of Nigeria periodically undertakes National Demographic and Health (NDH) surveys, which tap information on various health indices including vaccination coverage. Limited studies have used the NDHS data to examine the trends in vaccination coverage for the assessment of successes or failures of the immunization efforts.
   Methods
   This study used four NDH Surveys datasets between 1990 and 2008, which generated child health information including the proportion that had had any or all basic childhood vaccines. A combined total of 44 071 (weighted) children were involved in the study. The trend and pattern of vaccination over 18 years were examined while selected factors were regressed to obtain predictors of child vaccinations in Nigeria.
   Results
   The most recent survey (2008) reported more complete vaccination apart from 1990, which was said to be inaccurate. In all surveys, children from mothers with higher education, who were delivered in hospitals, lived in urban areas, and whose mothers work outside the home had significantly higher proportions of completed basic vaccination. A lower level of childhood vaccination is observed in the northern parts, while higher rates are observed in the southern parts. More complete vaccination coverage was reported in the 1990 survey, followed by 2008, 1999 and 2003. In addition, children from mothers with higher levels of education, who were delivered in hospitals, who lived in urban areas, and whose mothers work outside the home had significantly higher proportions of completed basic vaccination.
   Conclusion
   Much more work needs to be done if more children are to be covered and thus reduce vaccine-preventable diseases.

AB Background: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content.
   Methods: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's kappa ranged 0.71-1.0 after double-coding.
   Results: The majority (89%) of individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as "trust," "alternatives," "safety," and "conspiracy." For example, a comment representative of "conspiracy" is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the "alternatives" sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals' profiles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water fluoridation and circumcision.
   Conclusions: Social media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, targeted messages to different constituencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Improved routine immunization (RI) coverage is recommended as the priority public health strategy to decrease vaccine-preventable diseases and eradicate polio in Pakistan and worldwide.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to ascertain whether customized, automated, one-way text messaging (short message service, SMS) reminders delivered to caregivers via mobile phones when a child is due for an RI visit can improve vaccination uptake and timelines in Pakistan.
   Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial, conducted in an urban squatter settlement area of Karachi, Pakistan. Infants less than 2 weeks of age with at least one family member who had a valid mobile phone connection and was comfortable receiving and reading SMS text messages were included. Participants were randomized to the intervention (standard care + one-way SMS reminder) or control (standard care) groups. The primary outcome was to compare the proportion of children immunized up to date at 18 weeks of age. Vaccine given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks schedule includes DPT-Hep-B-Hib vaccine (ie, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus; hepatitis B; and Haemophilus influenza type b) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Data were analyzed using chi-square tests of independence and tested for both per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses.
   Results: Out of those approached, 84.3% (300/356) of the participants were eligible for enrollment and 94.1% (318/338) of the participants had a working mobile phone. Only children in the PP analyses, who received an SMS reminder for vaccine uptake at 6 weeks visit, showed a statistically significant difference (96.0%, 86/90 vs 86.4%, 102/118; P=.03).The immunization coverage was consistently higher in the intervention group according to ITT analyses at the 6 weeks scheduled visit (76.0% vs 71.3%, P=.36). The 10 weeks scheduled visit (58.7% vs 52.7%, P=.30) and the 14 weeks scheduled visit (31.3% vs 26.0%, P=.31), however, were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Automated simple one-way SMS reminders in local languages might be feasible for improving routine vaccination coverage. Whether one-way SMS reminders alone can have a strong impact on parental attitudes and behavior for improvement of RI coverage and timeliness needs to be further evaluated by better-powered studies and by comparing different types and content of text messages in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).

AB India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is among the largest routine childhood vaccination programmes in the world. However, only an estimated 65% of Indian children under the age 2 years were fully vaccinated in 2019. We estimated the cost of raising childhood vaccination coverage to a minimum of 90% in each district in India. We obtained vaccine price data from India's comprehensive multi-year strategic plan for immunization. Cost of vaccine delivery by district was derived from a 2018 field study in 24 districts. We used propensity score matching methods to match the remaining Indian districts with these 24, based on indicators from the National Family Health Survey (2015-16). We assumed the same unit cost of vaccine delivery in matched pair districts and estimated the total and incremental cost of providing routine vaccines to 90% of the current cohort of children in each district. The estimated national cost of providing basic vaccinations-one dose each of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and measles vaccines, and three doses each of oral polio (OPV) and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccines-was $784.91 million (2020 US$). Considering all childhood vaccines included in UIP during 2018-22 (one dose each of BCG, hepatitis B and measles-rubella; four doses of OPV; two doses of inactivated polio; and three doses each of rotavirus, pneumococcal and pentavalent vaccines), the estimated national cost of vaccines and delivery to 90% of target children in each district was $1.73 billion. The 2018 UIP budget for vaccinating children, pregnant women and adults was $1.17 billion (2020 US$). In comparison, $1.73 billion would be needed to vaccinate 90% of children in all Indian districts with the recommended schedule of routine childhood vaccines. Additional costs for infrastructural investments and communication activities, not incorporated in this study, may also be necessary.

AB Background. It has been suggested that childhood vaccinations may be associated with the onset of asthma. We investigated the association between asthma, atopy and vaccination history in a cohort of young adults living in Melbourne, Australia.
   Methods: Subjects were aged between 22 and 44 years and were surveyed by an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Questions were asked about vaccinations to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), triple antigen (DTP), hepatitis B and Sabin polio vaccine (OPV). Atopy was assessed by skin prick testing to common aeroallergens.
   Results: There was no significant association observed for subjects diagnosed with asthma who had received measles or MMR vaccinations compared with those who did not receive measles or MMR vaccinations (RR 1.33, 95% Cl 0.98-1.80). Non-significant associations were also observed for OPV and hepatitis B vaccinations (RR 3.27, 95% Cl 0.50-21.3 and FIR 1.08, 95% Cl 0.83-1.41, respectively). However, subjects reporting full immunisation were found to be at higher risk to asthma (RR 1.52, 95% Cl 1.09-2.11) but not atopy.
   Conclusions: Our results show relatively weak support for the hypothesis that childhood vaccinations may lead to increased risk of asthma, but caution is advised due to possible recall bias.

AB Universal vaccination coverage is still far from desired targets in many global regions including Pakistan, despite the success stories and its scientifically proven benefits. EPI Pakistan vaccination coverage data 2012-2016, at district level was collected from Federal EPI Pakistan. District-wise population data were collected from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Descriptive statistics and sequence plots were performed in SPSS 13.0. Purely spatial scanning analysis was done in SaTScan 9.4.4 using discrete Poisson model for detection of low vaccination coverage clusters. Geographical information system (GIS) was used to display spatial patterns and clusters of low vaccination coverage districts in Pakistan. Average annual EPI vaccination coverage in each study year were; 70.98 in 2012, 69.39% in 2013, 66.74% in 2014, 61.47% in 2015, and 67.01% in 2016, respectively. Cumulative average national vaccination rate (2012-2016) for all types of EPI vaccines was 60.60%. Average national vaccination rate for BCG, OPV3, pentavalent3 and measles1 was 67.12%, 58.53%, 58.47%, and 58.29%, respectively. Spatial cluster analysis demonstrated that most of low coverage districts for BCG, OPV3 and pentavalent3 were from FATA and KPK; while measles1 low coverage districts belonged to Balochistan. Future research should probe factors involved in low vaccination coverage in high risk districts.

AB Background: A variety of studies have considered the affects of India's son preference on gender differences in child mortality, sex ratio at birth, and access to health services. Less research has focused on the affects of son preference on gender inequities in immunization coverage and how this may have varied with time, and across regions and with sibling compositions. We present a systematic examination of trends in immunization coverage in India, with a focus on inequities in coverage by gender, birth order, year of birth, and state.
   Methods: We analyzed data from three consecutive rounds of the Indian National Family Health Survey undertaken between 1992 and 2006. All children below five years of age with complete immunization histories were included in the analysis. Age-appropriate immunization coverage was determined for the following antigens: bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), oral polio (OPV), diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus (DPT), and measles.
   Results: Immunization coverage in India has increased since the early 1990s, but complete, age-appropriate coverage is still under 50% nationally. Girls were found to have significantly lower immunization coverage (p<0.001) than boys for BCG, DPT, and measles across all three surveys. By contrast, improved coverage of OPV suggests a narrowing of the gender differences in recent years. Girls with a surviving older sister were less likely to be immunized compared to boys, and a large proportion of all children were found to be immunized considerably later than recommended.
   Conclusions: Gender inequities in immunization coverage are prevalent in India. The low immunization coverage, the late immunization trends and the gender differences in coverage identified in our study suggest that risks of child mortality, especially for girls at higher birth orders, need to be addressed both socially and programmatically.

AB Background India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) provides basic vaccines free-of-cost in the public sector, yet national vaccination coverage is poor. The Government of India has urged an expanded role for the private sector to help achieve universal immunization coverage. We conducted a state-by-state analysis of the role of the private sector in vaccinating Indian children against each of the six primary childhood diseases covered under India's UIP.
   Methods We analyzed IMS Health data on Indian private-sector vaccine sales, 2011 Indian Census data and national household surveys (DHS/NFHS 2005-06 and UNICEF CES 2009) to estimate the percentage of vaccinated children among the 2009-12 birth cohort who received a given vaccine in the private sector in 16 Indian states. We also analyzed the estimated private-sector vaccine shares as function of state-specific socio-economic status.
   Results Overall in 16 states, the private sector contributed 4.7% towards tuberculosis (Bacillus Calmette-Gu,rin (BCG)), 3.5% towards measles, 2.3% towards diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT3) and 7.6% towards polio (OPV3) overall (both public and private sectors) vaccination coverage. Certain low income states (Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Assam and Bihar) have low private as well as public sector vaccination coverage. The private sector's role has been limited primarily to the high income states as opposed to these low income states where the majority of Indian children live. Urban areas with good access to the private sector and the ability to pay increases the Indian population's willingness to access private-sector vaccination services.
   Conclusion In India, the public sector offers vaccination services to the majority of the population but the private sector should not be neglected as it could potentially improve overall vaccination coverage. The government could train and incentivize a wider range of private-sector health professionals to help deliver the vaccines, especially in the low income states with the largest birth cohorts. We recommend future studies to identify strengths and limitations of the public and private health sectors in each Indian state.

AB Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine the coverage of the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) of the Ministry of Health and the coverage of private vaccines in the Umraniye Health District in order to establish approaches for improving vaccination services. Other objectives were to define the areas that present higher risks for non-vaccination and to determine the factors that influence vaccination coverage.
   Methods: A '30X7' cluster sampling design was adopted as the sampling method. Thirty streets were selected at random from each healthcare region. Sociodemographic and socio-economic characteristics of the population, utilization of vaccination services and vaccination status of children under the age of 5 years were determined by face-to-face interviews. Odds ratios for the sociodemographic and socio-economic characteristics, health centre region and inner country immigration were assessed as possible related factors with the vaccination coverage rates for children under 5 years and under 1 year using the backward elimination method in logistic regression.
   Results: Vaccination coverage was as follows: hepatitis B third dose, 84.6%; Bacitle Calmette-Guerin, 94.8%; diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DPT) third dose, 90.1%; oral polio virus (OPV) third dose, 90.0%; measles, 88.7%; DPT booster dose, 79.1%; OPV booster dose, 79.0%; measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), 13.3%; haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), 9.3%; and Varicella vaccine, 3.3%. The full vaccination rates for children under 5 years and under 1 year were 68.3 and 79.5%, respectively. Higher socioeconomic status was associated with a higher rate of full vaccination and private vaccination for children under 5 years of age.
   Conclusions: Full vaccination rates for children aged less than 1 year and less than 5 years were higher in our district than in Istanbul. However, we did not meet the EPI aims for any of the vaccines, and differences were observed in vaccination coverage rates between different socio-economic groups in the district. Therefore, an intervention programme should be considered to achieve the EPI's goals, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Also, the coverage of private vaccination (MMR, Hib, Varicella) is tow and more children from higher socioeconomic groups receive these vaccines. (c) 2005 The Royal Institute of Public Health.
